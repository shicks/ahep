# America Takes Flight

## Introduction

Wilbur and Orville Wright taught mankind to fly. And they did it in typical American fashion. Two brothers, both high school drop-outs, tinkering in their backyard and their bicycle shop, taught themselves the science of flight, and invented powered airplanes.

Self-reliance, perseverance, teamwork, and an incredible work ethic were all key components to their revolutionary invention. We shouldn’t forget the courage it took either. How many times did they crash and risk injury when testing their experimental designs?

The brothers were also motivated by the American free enterprise system. They patented many aspects of their airplane – and then had the perseverance to fight through the courts to establish their patents.

However, both Wilbur and Orville point to another factor entirely as the most important aspect of their success. It is something homeschooling families know intuitively. You can read it in the “Famous Quotes” activity below.

## American Heritage Songbook: Wild Blue Yonder: The U.S. Air Force Song {#songbook}

```metadata
toc: "American Heritage Songbook: _Wild Blue Yonder_"
time: 5 minutes
freq: daily
```

> Off we go into the wild blue yonder,
> Climbing high into the sun;
> Here they come, zooming to meet our thunder,
> At them boys, Give ‘er the gun!
{.nowrap}

Written in 1939, this song won the competition to be the official song of what was, at the time, the Army Air Corps. Commanders of the Army Air Corps  wanted an official song to help define them as a unique branch of the military; out of hundreds of entries, this was the hands-down winner. It wasn’t until shortly after World War II, in 1947, that the Army Air Corps officially became the newest branch of America’s military, the United States Air Force.

The original lyrics of the  second verse reminds us of the brilliance of the Wright Brothers:

> Minds of men fashioned a crate of thunder,
> Sent it high into the blue;
> Hands of men blasted the world asunder;
> How they lived God only knew!
> Souls of men dreaming of skies to conquer
> Gave us wings, ever to soar!
{.nowrap}

There are numerous versions available on YouTube; [this one has the lyrics on-screen][song1] and photos of the many types of aircraft in the Air Force.  [This version][song2] includes scenes from World War II.

## Arts & Crafts: Make Your Own Biplane {#craft1}

```metadata
time: 30-60 minutes
prep: 15-20 minutes
supplies: clothespin, hot glue gun, craft sticks, markers
```

> The craft was of pinewood covered with fabric and sealed with shellac.
{.nowrap}

We have two options for making your own model biplane: clothespin biplanes and toilet paper roll biplanes.  The clothespin biplanes are simpler to put together, but don’t have a propeller that one can actually spin.  Both are fun and cute!

As your kids are working (and playing) with their biplanes, look for opportunities to talk about the book and how determined and hardworking the Wright Brothers were. Then, point out examples to your kids about times when they exhibited the same qualities.

Clothespin biplane
([Based on AdventureSci.org][craft2])

### Supplies

* Clothespin
* Two craft sticks
* One mini craft stick
* Markers or paint
* Hot glue


### Directions
1. Paint or use markers to decorate the clothespin and craft sticks.

2. When they are dry/decorated, hot glue the craft sticks to the clothespin.  Put the mini craft stick on the very end (the end that you pinch to open the clothespin).  Put the regular craft sticks on opposite sides of the clothespin (slightly below the opposite end as the mini craft stick).  We placed ours to cover the metal spring parts.

Toilet Paper Roll Biplane
([Based on PinkStripeySocks.com][craft1])

### Supplies

* Empty toilet paper roll
* Cereal box
* Brad or similar fastener
* Two large craft sticks
* Two mini craft sticks (or a regular craft stick broken in half)
* Two pennies (or other small weights)
* Stapler
* Paint
* Glue gun
* Scissors
* Optional: hole punch


### Directions
1. Hot glue the two pennies inside the toilet paper roll close to one edge.  This will be the back of the plane (which needs some extra weight in order to stand given the weight of the front of the plane).

2. Staple the back of the toilet paper roll (where the pennies are) shut.  Make two small slits on the bottom of the toilet paper roll about in the middle (this will allow you to slide in the craft stick legs later).  

3. Out of the cereal box cut two small circles for wheels (about the size of pennies), one large circle (the size of the opening of the toilet paper roll), one fat rectangle (about 1” x 1.5”), two narrow rectangles (about 0.5” x 2”), and a propeller.

4. Paint the toilet paper roll, all the craft sticks, and all the items cut from the cereal box.  Except for the large circle, all items should be painted on both sides.  Wait for everything to dry.

5. Punch a hole through the center of the large circle and middle of propeller.  Connect them using the brad.

6. Use the hot glue gun to put all the pieces together: glue the large circle with propeller to the open end of the toilet paper roll.  Glue the small circles to the bottom of the mini craft sticks.  Glue the mini craft sticks into the slits in the bottom of the toilet paper roll.  Glue the larger craft sticks horizontally on either side of the toilet paper roll.  Glue the narrow rectangles to the two craft stick wings to connect them.

7. Admire your model and use your finger to spin the propeller.

## Geography: Ohio and Kitty Hawk, North Carolina {#geography}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
supplies: U.S. puzzle
```

> Will and Orv needed somewhere with open spaces and strong, regular breezes… 
> At last they settled on Kitty Hawk on the Outer Banks, a two-hundred-mile strip of sand with the ocean at its face and North Carolina at its back.


Geography played an important role in the Wright Brothers’ pioneering experiments in powered flight. They needed strong, sustained wind to provide lift, especially in the early days when they were learning to control the aircraft through gliding. Why did they need open spaces? Again, the issue is all about control. In the early days, they were learning how to control the aircraft and didn’t know where their experiments would end up landing – or crashing, as happened many times. Which is also why the 200 miles of sand dunes were an important aspect of the geography they were looking for. The sand made for a softer landing (or crash) than other surfaces.

You can demonstrate the importance of their criteria (wind and wide open spaces) by taking your kids kite flying. On a windy day, talk to them about the best conditions for kite-flying and pick the best spot together, connecting the experience with how the Wright Brothers had to find the location for their flight. 

There were a couple of other criteria that played a role in their selection of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Pull out a map of the United States and ask your kids to indicate the location of Dayton, Ohio. In addition to Kitty Hawk, the Wrights also considered San Diego, California and St. James, Florida as possible locations for their experiments. By looking at all three locations relative to Dayton, Ohio, can your kids see another reason for picking Kitty Hawk? Yes, North Carolina is much closer to Ohio than California or Florida.

Back in 1900 it took 3-5 days by train, followed by a boat trip, to reach Kitty Hawk. There were no bridges and no roads for the last part of the journey. Isolation  was the final geographical factor they wanted. The Wright Brothers were competing with others to be the first to fly. An isolated location for their experiments could help keep their experimental flights secret from others who might steal their ideas.

[This short video][geo1] by the National Park Service shows what the isolated, windy, sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina looked like back when the Wright Brothers were experimenting there in 1900-1903.

Have your children figure out a travel route from Dayton, Ohio to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  This is a great opportunity to incorporate some important life skills into a geography lesson.  You can read about the Wright Route [here][geo3].

Print out [an Amtrak map][geo2] and ask your child(ren) to plan a trip with Amtrak from Dayton, Ohio to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.. Together figure out the closest Amtrak stops. 

Using the map,  plan which Amtrak trains you would need to take. Then go to the Amtrak website and add your family information, i.e., the  number of adults and children travelling from/to. 

Then together look up how long it would take (hours or days?), how many times you need to change trains and how much it would cost to go on the trip. Compare how long it would take you to travel by how long it took them to get there.  Also compare it to Google Maps drive time, if instead you would go on a road trip by car.

## Famous American Quotes: The Importance of Family {#text}

```metadata
time: 5 minutes
freq: daily
```

> What had transpired that day in 1903, in the stiff winds and cold of the Outer Banks in less than two hours time, was one of the turning points in history, the beginning of change for the world far greater than any of those present could possibly have imagined. With their homemade machine, Wilbur and Orville Wright had shown without a doubt that man could fly and if the world did not yet know it, they did.
> – David McCullough


It is astonishing to look back more than a century ago  to see what two high school dropouts accomplished. Self-taught engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs, the turning point in their manned flight experiments came when they decided the existing data on lift and drag were wrong. They built their own wind tunnel to get precise measurements and then applied them to the wing design of their Flyers. 

Where did the confidence to question the prevailing scientific orthodoxy and the perseverance to keep going in the face of repeated failures come from? Both Orville and Wilbur attribute it to their family:

> But it isn’t true to say we had no special advantages . . . the greatest thing in our favor was growing up in a family where there was always much encouragement to intellectual curiosity.
> – Orville Wright

> If I were giving a young man advice as to how he might succeed in life, I would say to him, pick out a good father and mother, and begin life in Ohio. 
> – Wilbur Wright

## Cooking: Strawberry Shortcake {#cookbook}

```metadata
time: 20-30 minutes
prep: 10-15 minutes
```

> And if you’re bored, if you’re hungry, there is the “butch” – a boy
> who walks the aisle and sells books, maps, magazines, yesterday’s
> paper, **fruits** and candies, soap and towels, coffee, tea, sugar,
> hash, beans, bacon, and all the cigars you can smoke.

The ancestors of today’s strawberry were a tiny but flavorful berry
native to Virginia and a large but bland berry native to Chile. They
were accidentally cross-bred in the 18th century but a version that
would grow in American soil wasn’t developed until the 1840s. And then
“Strawberry Fever” swept America. From 1858 to 1870, a 12-year period
that saw the first transcontinental railroad built, strawberries
commanded premium prices. While we don’t know if the “butch” sold
strawberries to railroad passengers, he might have.

Strawberry Shortcake became an iconic American dessert. The sweeter
variety uses angel food cake as the shortcake and was more prevalent
in the northern states. The southern states favored a buttermilk
biscuit for the shortcake. While not raised in the south, our
traditional family recipe for Strawberry Shortcake is based on the
buttermilk biscuit.

### Ingredients

* 2 cups flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup sugar
* ½ cup margarine/butter (softened)
* 1 egg
* ⅔ cup milk

### Directions
1. Mix flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and margarine/butter to make
   thick dough
2. Break egg and drop it into cup, beat, and fill with milk to 1 cup
   level
3. Add egg and milk mixture to dough, mix
4. Divide into two greased pie tins
5. Bake at 400-425 degrees for 15-20 minutes until golden brown
6. Serve hot with strawberries and half-and-half
7. Beware, this recipe may be habit forming!

## Science: Steam Power {#science}

```metadata
time: 15-20 minutes
prep: 30-60 minutes
supplies: tea kettle (or covered pot)
```

> The sounds of the engine surround him:
> the rhythm of pistons, pounding like hammers,
> the drivers drumming the rails,
> the smoke and the steam rushing up through the stack:
> CHUG-CHUG CHUG-CHUG CHUG-CHUG!
{.nowrap}

Brian Floca does not waste any space in _Locomotive_. Inside the front
cover, he illustrates the geography, map, and political history of the
first transcontinental railroad. Inside the back cover, he illustrates
the science and engineering that power the locomotives of that era.

The upper left-hand corner of the back cover illustrates a simple
experiment you can do with your kid(s) to show them the basic
principle of steam power. Water, when heated, turns to steam which
takes much more space than the liquid water. If the expansion into
steam is confined to a small space it exerts a force. That force can
be used to lift the lid on a covered pot, make a tea kettle whistle,
or even power a locomotive that pulls an entire train.

1. Boil water in an open pot. Point out the steam rising and vanishing
   without exerting any pressure
2. Boil water in a teapot (preferably one that whistles to announce
   that water is boiling). Point out that the steam is making the
   teapot whistle.
3. Alternatively, place a cover on the open pot. The steam will
   periodically lift the pot, demonstrating the force it exerts.
4. Serve yourself and the kid(s) some tea and discuss how simple
   processes can be harnessed to accomplish big things.

## Historical Re-enactment: Build Your Own Transcontinental Railroad {#re-enactment}

```metadata
toc: "Re-enactment: Build Your Own Transcontinental Railroad"
time: 20-60 minutes
prep: 20-30 minutes
supplies: toy railroad tracks and locomotives (Brio, Hape, etc.)
```

> Here is a road
> made for crossing the country,
> A new road of rails made for people to ride.
{.nowrap}

This activity can work with as little as two people. However, it works
best with more so you can have two teams competing against each other
(and the clock) to build your own transcontinental railroad. Think
about inviting extended family, friends, or other homeschooling
families to join you in this friendly competition.

To start, you will need to construct your own continent that needs
crossing. It could be two rooms of your home that need to be
connected, with one room labeled EAST and the other WEST (or Omaha and
Sacramento). Two sides of a room could also work. Or perhaps somewhere
outside. However you decide, there will need to be “mountain ranges”
for each side to overcome as they build their railroad toward a
designated meeting place. Be creative with placing the “mountain
range” obstacles. The teams will have the most fun figuring out how to
build their railroad around, over, and through the obstacles.

The two teams, Central Pacific (CP) and Union Pacific (UP), will need
to be supplied with generous portions of railroad track (we used
Brio). The goal for each team is to build their railroad as quickly as
possible, overcoming any obstacles along the way. Once the road is
laid down, a locomotive and tender must traverse it and meet the other
team at “Promontory Summit” for the Golden Spike ceremony. If you have
battery-powered locomotives it can be fun to see if they can
successfully make the journey to the halfway point.

There are multiple competitive opportunities you can incorporate –
which team builds the most track, which team arrives at “Promontory
Summit” first. To simulate the incentives that motivated the CP and UP
you can reward the teams with candy or snacks for every piece of track
laid (creating a perverse incentive to use short pieces of track,
similar to the perverse incentives the government used to make the CP
and UP build longer tracks and routes rather than shorter, more
efficient routes).

## Supplemental Reading: _Ten Mile Day_ {#supplemental}

```metadata
time: 15 minutes
```

> But Crocker and his crew had learned from their hardships. Now they
> were an efficient force.  As the transcontinental railroad was
> nearing completion, his army stood ready for its final battle, Ten
> Mile Day.

_Ten Mile Day_, written and illustrated by Mary Ann Fraser, is an
excellent supplemental reading to _Locomotive_. _Ten Mile Day_ focuses
on how the railroad was built with particular emphasis on the Central
Pacific’s Chinese immigrant workforce and how they overcame not only
the prejudices against them but also the dangerous challenges they
faced. Fraser engages the reader by framing her story around the
ten-mile-day bet between Charles Crocker of the Central Pacific and
Thomas Durant of the Union Pacific.

_Ten Mile Day_ has much more text than _Locomotive_ so we suggest
reading it once during the week either in addition to _Locomotive_ or
perhaps instead of it.

## Scripture: Galatians 3:28 {#scripture}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for
> you are all one in Christ Jesus. (Galatians 3:28)

The scripture above is echoed in 1 Corinthians 12:13. The words on the
Golden Spike echo these words from the Bible, emphasizing unity. And
it seems a fitting verse considering events surrounding the building
of the transcontinental railroad.

Abraham Lincoln signed the legislation authorizing the
transcontinental railroad in 1862, the middle of our great Civil War
that would lead to the abolition of slavery in America. But slaves
weren’t the only people discriminated against. The men who built the
first transcontinental railroad generally came from ethnic immigrants,
Irish for the Union Pacific, and Chinese for the Central Pacific,
denied opportunities available to other Americans.

Despite the prejudices against them, these men demonstrated the “Full
Steam Ahead” spirit of Americans, completing the first
transcontinental railroad a year ahead of schedule – with a final,
recordbreaking sprint of ten miles in a single day by the Central
Pacific Chinese teams. As part of the Golden Spike ceremony, eight
Chinese in new blue jackets laid the final pair of rails.

It took many more decades for the contributions these immigrants made
to be recognized as part of the promise to all Americans. Consider
having your kids memorize the scripture above as a reminder of the
unity we should all feel as Americans, no matter where we originated
from. E Pluribus Unum!

```

> If the rails are slick,
> if the wheels won’t catch,
> the engineers can pull a handle
> to drop some sand
> down a tube, onto the tracks.
> The wheels hit the grit,
> the **traction** does the trick..

This module’s vocabulary words are evenly divided between railroad
terms (tender, throttle, trestles, traction), and words describing the
country and towns the first transcontinental railroad traveled through
(frontier, rugged, rowdy, bleak).

Tender
: a railroad car filled with fuel and water for a steam locomotive

Throttle
: a control for regulating how fast or slow to go by allowing more or
  less steam into the engine

Frontier
: where the known, settled parts of a region end and the unknown,
  unsettled parts begin

Rugged
: rough, uneven

Trestles
: a supporting structure for a road or railroad bridge

Rowdy
: noisy, disorderly, rough

Bleak
: empty, unwelcoming, without hope

Traction
: the ability of a wheel or tire to hold the ground without sliding

## Writing: Onomatopoeia {#writing}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> … through the Great Basin,
> a bleak and silent land–
> silent except for the
> HUFF and the
> BANG and the
> HISS of the engine,
> the CLICK and the CLACK of the cars.
{.nowrap}

The long word onomatopoeia means to form a word from the sound it
makes. Brian Floca, the author, uses onomatopoeia extensively
throughout the story as he describes the sounds of the locomotive. In
the sentence above, he uses it five times. In other places, his
artwork emphasizes it even more: the “rickety, rickety, rickety” of
the trestles, the “ka-boom” of a locomotive exploding.

Ask your kids to look for other examples of sounds turned into words
throughout the story. They are usually indicated by capital letters
and artfully drawn letters. But occasionally, the author uses the big
letters to emphasize action, so the kids will have to pay attention!

## Civic Culture: Full Steam Ahead {#culture}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> He is the master of his machine,
> he knows her moods and tempers,
> where to set her bars and levers,
> when to slow down and when to speed up,
> when to run her wide open –
> FULL STEAM AHEAD!
{.nowrap}

Nowadays the expression, “Full steam ahead!” means to give a maximum
effort with all the energy and enthusiasm you can muster. What a great
description of the entrepreneurial engine that drives American
innovation!

The expression originates from the early days of the steam engines on
boats and locomotives.  Locomotive engineers and ship captains would
order “Full steam ahead!” when they wanted maximum power from their
steam engines.

Think of a time when you were “Full steam ahead!” and share the story
with your kids. Ask them about the last time they went “Full steam
ahead!”
