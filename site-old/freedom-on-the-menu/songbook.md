No one knows the exact origin of this song but it goes back at least
to the 1930s. Many, many people and groups have recorded a variation
of it; the simple lyrics lend themselves to adaptations. The song is a
staple in many Christian children’s song books and is believed by many
to be inspired by scripture (specifically, Matthew 5: 14-16, see
below).  The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s adopted it as one of
its anthems. You can [hear it sung] here in a recording preserved by the
Smithsonian Institute in a project called The Story of the Civil
Rights Movement through its songs.  Raffi, the well-known children’s
music artist recorded his version [here][raffi]. Even Bruce Springsteen
[recorded his version].
