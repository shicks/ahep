## Biography: Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the leading figure in the
Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Like his father and grandfather
before him, he was a Baptist minister. He was a master strategist when
it came to non-violent protests. He continually called for America to
live up to her ideals, pointing us back to our founding document and
Thomas Jefferson’s revolutionary phrase that “all men are created
equal.”

In October of 1960, just a few months after the Greensboro Four
started the sit-ins that swept through the South, Reverend King joined
the Atlanta sit-ins at a restaurant inside Rich’s, a rival department
store to Woolworth’s. He was arrested and, because of his prominence,
was the only one sentenced to hard labor at a maximum-security
prison. Pressure from political figures resulted in his release two
days later. This was only one of the more than 20 times King was
arrested for peacefully protesting.
