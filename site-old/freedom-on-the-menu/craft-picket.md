## Arts & Crafts: Make Your Own Picket Sign

### Supplies

* Paint (can make your own—see below)
* Paint brushes
* Cardboard or thick paper (cardstock, etc.)
* Hole punch
* String
* Craft sticks
* Glue

### Directions

1. Discuss what the picket sign should say or look like.  What message
   is trying to be conveyed?  What words or pictures convey this
   message?
1. Use the paint and paint brushes on the cardboard to make a picket
   sign.
1. Once the paint is dry, glue a craft stick on to the cardboard to
   create a handle to hold.
1. Alternatively, make two hole punches, one on each top corner of the
   cardboard sign.  Repeat with a second cardboard sign. Tie string
   from one cardboard hole to the other piece of cardboard’s hole.
   Repeat on the other side.  Slip this over your child’s head for a
   “sandwich” board version.
