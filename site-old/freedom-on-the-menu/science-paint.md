## Science: Make Your Own Paint and Color Mixing

You can make homemade finger paint (for picket signs among other things).

### Supplies

* 1 cup flour
* 2.5 cups cold water
* 2 tablespoons salt
* Food coloring
* Sauce pan
* Wooden spoon
* Several small containers (ice cube tray, small class jars, paper cups, or muffin tin)
* Cardboard or thick paper
* Fingers or thick paint brushes
* Paper towels

### Directions

1. Mix together the flour and water in a sauce pan over low heat.
Once the mixture is smooth (lumps have been removed) add the salt and
stir again until smooth.
1. Remove from heat.  Pour or spoon the mixture into several small
   containers.  Set aside until cool.
1. Add different food colorings to the different containers and mix it
   in.
1. Use fingers or paint brushes to apply paint to cardboard.
1. Clean up with paper towels.

We took the opportunity to discuss what colors to mix to create other
colors.  After the basic rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
purple), we also worked on some other colors (black, pink) and how to
make the shades darker or lighter.

Our “finger paint” came out pretty thick and a little blobby.  It
worked out okay, but took a while to dry.  My toddler was hands-on
into it.  My 6-year-old preferred using thick paint brushes.  The
mixture took the food coloring quite well and the colors were fairly
vibrant. See [here][paints] for more details.

There are many other DIY paint options, here’s [another] you might
try.
