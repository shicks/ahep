## Famous American Texts: _I Have a Dream_

> I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:
> “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”
> …
> I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation
> where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech galvanized our
nation, reminding people of our founding creed — and how black
Americans had all too often been excluded from the American dream. The
speech was delivered by King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on
the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation to a quarter of
a million people lining the National Mall and millions more via
television. It vaulted King to the forefront of the national Civil
Rights movement and helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 which abolished all of the Jim Crow laws that discriminated
against black Americans.

To experience the power and the poetry of his speech, your children
need to [hear Dr. King deliver it]. To help them internalize it, ask
them to memorize one of the lines above.
