## Political Geography: Jim Crow Laws

> “Connie, the sit-ins have spread all over the South,” said Daddy.

The Greensboro sit-ins spread rapidly. By the end of the month
(February) they had jumped from North Carolina to South Carolina,
Tennessee, Maryland, Kentucky, Alabama, Virginia, and Florida. By
March, they were happening in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Georgia. After that, people rose up in West Virginia, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Mississippi, Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri. All told, scholars
estimate 70,000 people, black and white, participated in the sit-ins.

Ask your kids to use a jigsaw puzzle of the United States (or a
coloring page) to illustrate how the sit-ins spread. First, assemble
the states that joined North Carolina in February. Ask them if they
notice anything about this first group of states (they are all very
close to North Carolina, where the sit-in movement started).

Next, ask them to add the states where sit-ins started in
March. Finally, ask them to add the last batch of states. Ask them if
there are any states that stand out in particular in this last
group. The law that prevented black Americans from eating at lunch
counters with white Americans is an example of a “Jim Crow” law – a
law that discriminates against some people based on the color of their
skin. Jim Crow laws are usually thought of as a phenomenon of southern
states. Are all the states in this last group southern states?
