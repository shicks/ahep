# A Pivotal Battle

## Introduction

This tale describes the iconic moment in America’s War of Independence
– the moment when we realized we could prevail over one of the
greatest military powers on earth, reclaim the rights we’d lost, and
begin the long, hard work of building a new nation. “Life, Liberty,
and the Pursuit of Happiness” and the hopes of the revolution all
hinged on these battles. Though not of critical importance as military
victories they were enormously important politically, coming at a time
early in the war when not only Washington’s troops but all Americans
were deeply discouraged after losing the critical battles in New York.

The fabled American work ethic is a prominent part of the story. It’s
Christmas Eve when most people are home with their families. Instead,
Washington’s army is ferrying two thousand men, horses, and cannon(!)
across a river so swollen with ice that two other regiments, crossing
at other locations, fail to make it across. After working all night,
Washington’s army then marched nine miles. All before the fighting
even starts.

The aftermath of the battle highlights another important
theme. Washington’s troops are all volunteers, most of them enlisted
for very short service stints of 2-6 months.  Washington must
continually appeal to their patriotism to get them to voluntarily
re-enlist. When he issued a call for additional volunteers for the
Princeton battle, they came from all around to risk their lives – an
extraordinary example of the power of voluntary associations.

## Famous American Texts: _The American Crisis_

```metadata
time: 5-10 minutes
freq: daily
```

Thomas Paine is most famous for his book _Common Sense_ that helped spark the revolution. However, his work _The American Crisis_ contains one of the most memorable lines in American history: “These are the times that try men’s souls.” Ask your child(ren) to memorize this line and repeat it each day of the week before or after each reading. Be sure to place the line in context, explaining why Americans were so discouraged at this point in the War of Independence. Older children may want to add the second, longer line: “The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.”

## Political Geography: Maps and Distances

```metadata
toc: "Political Geography: Maps & Distances"
time: 15 minutes
supplies: U.S. map puzzle
```

> In early December the Americans made it across the Delaware River
> into Pennsylvania.  Under General Washington’s orders they had taken
> every boat they could find with them, so they knew they were safe
> from the British for a while.

Examine a map of the Delaware River (use the one on the inside of the cover). How wide was the river where Washington and his army crossed? Use fingers or string to measure the distance using the scale bar. Why did they choose to cross where they did? How far did they have to hike to Trenton once they crossed the river? Use the string to measure the distance. Now, measure the distance from Trenton to Princeton. Use a map program (e.g., Google Map, Apple Map) to show how long it would take to travel the distance by car. How long did it take Washington’s army to march to Princeton?

## Arts & Crafts: Coloring and Mixed-Media Art Project

```metadata
time: 30-40 minutes
prep: 10 minutes
supplies: popsicle sticks, cotton balls, glue, construction paper,
          crayons, scissors
```

> On Christmas night, 1776, General Washington led twenty-four hundred
> men, the main body of his army, to a crossing point about nine miles
> upstream from Trenton.

One of the most iconic images in American history is that of Washington crossing the Delaware. You can expose younger children to this image by downloading and printing a sheet that they can color with their crayons. You can find a couple of examples on the internet [here][1] or [here][2]. Older kids might enjoy this mixed-media art project:

[2]: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/b0/61/0ab061362550471bf05dc4d8484cc4df.gif

### Supplies
* Popsicle (craft) sticks
* Construction paper (black, dark blue, white)
* Cotton balls
* Glue stick or Elmer’s Glue
* Crayons (or markers)
* Scissors
* Cardboard (optional)
* Washington coloring sheet (optional; see links above)
* Free hand outline of flag (for kids to color in)

### Instructions
1. Glue a sheet of black construction paper to a piece of cardboard.
   This is optional but will provide more stability as the craft
   sticks will be heavy if it is only paper.
1. Cut a strip of dark blue construction paper and glue it to the
   bottom of the black construction paper.  This is the Delaware
   river.
1. Design a boat out of craft sticks.  Optionally, color the craft
   sticks with crayons or markers.  Glue craft sticks in the form of a
   boat to the construction.  Leave one craft stick for a flag pole
   and glue it so it is sticking out of the top of the boat.
1. Color in the flag and glue it to the flagpole.
1. Add cotton balls to represent the chunks of ice.
1. Optionally, cut out Washington and/or soldiers from coloring sheets
   and add them to the boat.

Depending on the age of the child they may need help with cutting
and/or gluing.  My three year old loved coloring craft sticks and
sticking cotton balls onto the sheet.  Both the five-year-old and
three-year-old liked adding the coloring sheet of Washington to the
picture (which made it more exciting).

## Science: Crossing the Delaware In a Soap-Powered Boat

```metadata
time: 20-30 minutes
prep: 10 minutes
supplies: foam paper plate, cake pan, liquid soap, ice cubes
```

The night was cold, and the men faced a difficult crossing. They had to break through ice to get the boats into the river. They had to fend off large chunks of floating ice once they were underway.

There are several videos on the internet that show you how to build a miniature boat powered by a bit of soap ([here’s one][3] and [here’s another][4]). For this activity you will want to work with your child(ren) on the following steps:

[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz9hkWhZfRM
[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miWlDVOhrSE

### Supplies
1.  Cut out your boat from a likely material (in the videos above, one
    uses cardboard the other uses a foam paper plate -- we favor the
    foam). Don’t forget the notch!. Decorate it with an American flag
    (only 13 stars!).
2.  Set up your Delaware River using something like a rectangular cake
    pan. Label one end Pennsylvania and the other end New Jersey (you
    can also label the water the Delaware River).
3.  Launch your boat near the Pennsylvania “shore” and apply the soap
    (or liquid detergent) to the notch in the stern to see it jet
    across to New Jersey.
4.  Put enough ice cubes into the middle of the cake pan to block your
    boat to simulate the conditions Washington and his army
    encountered.
5.  Repeat step 3. Did your boat successfully cross the Delaware?

### Discuss with your young scientist(s)
*   Does everything float in water? Why do you think the ice floats?
    (It’s less dense)
*   Besides getting in the way, is there any other danger associated
    with ice? Could it damage the boats?
*   What powered the soap boat? (The soap reduced the surface tension,
    pushing the boat forward). Illustrate surface tension by filling a
    glass with water just past the lip.
*   If water turns to solid ice when it gets cold, what happens to it
    when it gets hot? Describe the three states of water: solid (ice),
    liquid (water), gas (steam).

## Historical Re-enactment: Create Your Own Surprise Attack

```metadata
toc: "Re-enactment: Surprise Attack!"
time: 20 minutes
prep: 10 minutes
supplies: Nerf guns or other harmless projectiles
```

> When the Americans encountered the first Hessians, it was clear the
> surprise had worked.  The startled Hessians retreated.

There are many creative ways to simulate Washington’s surprise attack
on the Hessians. Ours was a multi-generational affair. Parents told
the kids that the grandparents were planning a surprise attack. They
barricaded the front door and kept a lookout through the front
window. Text messages apprised them of progress (“Washington is
crossing the Delaware.” “Washington’s army is on the march.”) while
the parents kept anticipation high. Grandparents entered through the
back door, approached from the rear, and surprised the kids by
shouting “The Hessians!” and “Attack! Attack!” Nerf weaponry was
involved (but rubber bands can also be fun). Stocking (or bare) feet
and blue cloaks/coats were worn to remind us of Washington’s army.

Surprise was total. After the shock wore off (and they had
surrendered), everyone retired to the living room for target practice
with the nerf guns (and their first lesson in range safety). At the
end of the evening, the five-year-old, with a big smile, said “You
really surprised us!” The three-year-old? “I liked the attack.”

Don’t be surprised when your kids ask for another Surprise Attack or
reverse the Surprise Attack a little later...

## Civic Culture: Washington’s Favorite Scripture

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> Every man will sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree;
> and no one will make them afraid: for the Lord Almighty has
> spoken. (Micah 4:4)

The Bible was so universally known in Washington’s time that many
times it would be quoted without attribution. People assumed you knew
they were quoting the Bible.

Washington’s writings contain hundreds of biblical references,
quotations, proverbs and allusions. His favorite scripture, based on
the number of times he referenced it in his writings, was Micah
4:4. Washington referenced this verse almost 50 times in his
writings. Ask your child(ren) why this might be the favorite verse of
the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army for seven long years?

## Civic Culture: Encouragement

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
freq: daily
```

> George Washington was discouraged. How could the Americans, who were
> mostly new to fighting, ever hope to defeat the well-trained
> redcoats?

As above, discuss with your child(ren) why Washington’s troops and all
Americans were discouraged. What raised the spirits of the soldiers
(and the country)? Where did they find encouragement? You might ask
your child(ren) if they remember a time when they were cold, tired,
and hungry.

As an activity, ask your child(ren) to encourage a family member or
friend at least once a day for the rest of the week (perhaps set up a
checklist or star chart to mark each occasion). Work on developing the
habit of encouraging one another, especially within your family. You
might want to link this exercise with the previous one by memorizing
the Bible verse “Encourage one another and build one another up” (1
Thessalonians 5:11).

## Civic Culture: Volunteer Associations

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> Drums rolled. A few of the men stepped forward, then more, and then
> more.  Many of Washington’s battle-tested soldiers resolved to stay
> at his side.

Washington’s army consisted of men who had voluntarily enlisted to
fight for their country’s freedom. Most of the enlistments were for
very short terms, two to six months.. Ask your child(ren) what they
would like to do to help the family. Have a list of tasks around the
house they could help with that are age appropriate (e.g., pick up
their room, set the table, put their toys away, fold their clean
clothes). Perhaps make it a “short-term enlistment” for just a
week. Construct a checklist or star chart so they can check off each
day they perform their volunteer activity. Perhaps ask them to extend
their voluntary enlistment at the end of the period now that they are
a “battle-tested veteran” just as Washington asked his volunteer army
to extend their commitments.

## History: Family Connections

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> Most of Washington’s men had the right to go home at the end of the
> year, but Washington needed them to stay.

History comes alive when you can make a personal connection to
historical events. Did any of your ancestors serve in the Continental
Army during the War of Independence? Or were they Loyalists,
supporting the British? It’s not unusual to have ancestors on both
sides of a conflict. If your family immigrated to America after the
War of Independence, where were they living during this time period?
When and why did they decide to come to America? Share their stories
with your children.

## Art: Find Washington

```metadata
time: 5 minutes
```

> Even when the struggle seemed hopeless,
> George Washington did not give up.

This activity can be fun for younger kids. Ask them if they can find
George Washington in each picture (he is not in every one of them).

---

## Art: Focal Point

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> He called a meeting of his generals and worked out a plan.

The [focal point][5] of a painting is the area that the artist wants
the viewer to pay the most attention. [A variety of techniques][6] are
used by artists to draw the viewer’s eye naturally to the area the
artist considers most important or most interesting. These techniques
include composition, converging lines, detail focus vs. blurring,
color contrast. Select some of your or your child(ren)’s favorite
paintings in the story and ask them to find the main focal point. Then
see if you can tell what technique the artist used to draw your eye to
the focal point.

[6]: https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-techniques/lets-talk-about-the-focal-point-in-art-part-1/

Younger children may just enjoy comparing the red professional coats
of the British army to the blue ragtags of Washington’s Continental
army as they page through the story.

## Language Arts: Quotations and Fonts

```metadata
time: 5 minutes
```

> “The force of the current, the sharpness of the frost …, the ice
> which made during the operation … rendered the passage of the river
> extremely difficult.”
> JAMES WILKINSON
> MAJOR, CONTINENTAL ARMY
{.nowrap}

As you read through the story, notice that each page has a sentence in
“quotation marks.” The words between the quotation marks are the
actual words that historical people spoke or wrote. Notice how each
quotation is attributed to a specific person, and some include
additional information about the speaker, in case the reader is
unfamiliar with the person being quoted. Notice also the use of fonts:
_italics_ for the quotation, **small capitals** for the speaker (and
even a smaller size font for the description of the person).

## Language Arts: Vocabulary and Idioms

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> But Washington had seafarers with him that night who knew how to
> navigate treacherous waters.

The author uses some words associated with armies and battles that
your child(ren) may not be familiar with: rebels, patriots,
treacherous, ammunition, artillery, regiment, musket, rally. Try
introducing a couple of the new words each day. Before you start
reading, introduce the words you’ve selected for the day, define them,
and then point them out during the reading.

Rebels
: men and women fighting against a government

Patriots
: men and women who love their country

Treacherous
: untrustworthy, unreliable

Ammunition
: objects that can be shot from a weapon, like bullets or cannon balls

Artillery
: very large guns moved on wheels, like cannons

Regiment
: a large group of soldiers

Musket
: gun with a long barrel, like a rifle

Rally
: join together in a shared effort

The author also includes idioms that may be worth pointing out to
older children who wonder what the author means by “summer soldier”
and “sunshine patriot.” Idioms are words, or a group of words, that
have a figurative meaning that is not obvious from its literal
definition. Authors use these figures of speech because their
descriptive imagery conveys a more vivid meaning to the reader. Idioms
are metaphorical and because the metaphors are often localized, people
from different regions may not immediately grasp their
meaning. Foreigners learning a new language are often baffled by
idioms. What did Thomas Paine mean when he referred to some people as
“summer soldiers” and “sunshine patriots”?

## Games: Stratego

```metadata
omit: true
time: 30 minutes
```

Stratego is a classic board game introduced in the United States
in 1961. Designed for two players, it is aimed at older children
(typically 8+). The goal is to capture the other team’s flag by
strategically placing and maneuvering your army (like Washington!)
around your opponent’s army. You can simplify the game for younger
children. What we suggest is eliminating part of the board and almost
half the pieces. We found our set on eBay.

### Discussion Questions
*   Why did Washington plan his attack for Christmas?
*   Why didn’t Washington attack Cornwallis directly?

---

## Civic Culture: Work Ethic

```metadata
omit: true
time: 10 minutes
```

Washington’s men had to work all night in a snowstorm, rowing across
the Delaware, moving men, horses, and cannon. And when they finished,
they had to hike nine miles and fight a battle. Share a story from
your past of when you had to work particularly hard to achieve a
goal. Have your spouse contribute a story as well. Or include a story
from a grandparent or other ancestor. Ask your child if they’ve ever
had to work really hard to achieve something. Remind them of learning
to crawl, walk, talk and the perseverance these required to master.
