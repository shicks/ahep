# Civil Rights

## Introduction

_Freedom on the Menu_ tells the story of one of the seminal events of
the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, as seen through the eyes of a
young girl and her family. We are introduced to Martin Luther King,
Jr., the man who galvanized the nation with his speeches and
non-violent protests. It was Martin Luther King, Jr. who repeatedly
reminded America of the claim in our founding document that “All Men
Are Created Equal” and asked America when that would be true for black
Americans.


While Martin Luther King, Jr. towers over the era of Civil Rights,
_Freedom on the Menu_ focuses on the story of ordinary people—an
ordinary family—rising up, organizing, marching, boycotting,
picketing, protesting, and practicing civil disobedience so that they
could participate fully in the American dream. It is a very American
story, the story of an oppressed people joining together voluntarily
across all walks of life to fight for the American ideal, that “All
Men Are Created Equal.”

Finally, it’s worth noting the importance of the family in this
story. Families are the fundamental unit of American society. _Freedom
on the Menu_ demonstrates the centrality of families for transmitting
values from one generation to the next. Connie’s parents, her older
brother and sister, even her great-Aunt Gertie all support the Civil
Rights movement – and young Connie wants to be part of it, too. The
author, Carole Boston Weatherford, shows us a loving family fighting
together, but in different ways, to move America closer to her own
ideals.

## American Heritage Songbook: This Little Light of Mine

> This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine
> Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
> Everywhere I go, I’m gonna let it shine
> Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

No one knows the exact origin of this song but it goes back at least
to the 1930s. Many, many people and groups have recorded a variation
of it; the simple lyrics lend themselves to adaptations. The song is a
staple in many Christian children’s song books and is believed by many
to be inspired by scripture (specifically, Matthew 5: 14-16, see
below).  The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s adopted it as one of
its anthems. You can [hear it sung] here in a recording preserved by the
Smithsonian Institute in a project called The Story of the Civil
Rights Movement through its songs.  Raffi, the well-known children’s
music artist recorded his version [here][raffi]. Even Bruce Springsteen
[recorded his version].

## Famous American Texts: _I Have a Dream_

|Cal | M2: Famous Texts: _I Have a Dream_
{:.metadata}

> I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:
> “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”
> …
> I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation
> where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech galvanized our
nation, reminding people of our founding creed — and how black
Americans had all too often been excluded from the American dream. The
speech was delivered by King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on
the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation to a quarter of
a million people lining the National Mall and millions more via
television. It vaulted King to the forefront of the national Civil
Rights movement and helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 which abolished all of the Jim Crow laws that discriminated
against black Americans.

To experience the power and the poetry of his speech, your children
need to [hear Dr. King deliver it]. To help them internalize it, ask
them to memorize one of the lines above.

## Political Geography: Jim Crow Laws

> “Connie, the sit-ins have spread all over the South,” said Daddy.

The Greensboro sit-ins spread rapidly. By the end of the month
(February) they had jumped from North Carolina to South Carolina,
Tennessee, Maryland, Kentucky, Alabama, Virginia, and Florida. By
March, they were happening in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Georgia. After that, people rose up in West Virginia, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Mississippi, Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri. All told, scholars
estimate 70,000 people, black and white, participated in the sit-ins.

Ask your kids to use a jigsaw puzzle of the United States (or a
coloring page) to illustrate how the sit-ins spread. First, assemble
the states that joined North Carolina in February. Ask them if they
notice anything about this first group of states (they are all very
close to North Carolina, where the sit-in movement started).

Next, ask them to add the states where sit-ins started in
March. Finally, ask them to add the last batch of states. Ask them if
there are any states that stand out in particular in this last
group. The law that prevented black Americans from eating at lunch
counters with white Americans is an example of a “Jim Crow” law – a
law that discriminates against some people based on the color of their
skin. Jim Crow laws are usually thought of as a phenomenon of southern
states. Are all the states in this last group southern states?

## Biography: Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.

> Later that week, our whole family went to hear Dr. King preach at the college chapel.
> I didn’t really understand all of his speech, but I liked his booming voice.
> It sounded as if he believed God was on our side.

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the leading figure in the
Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Like his father and grandfather
before him, he was a Baptist minister. He was a master strategist when
it came to non-violent protests. He continually called for America to
live up to her ideals, pointing us back to our founding document and
Thomas Jefferson’s revolutionary phrase that “all men are created
equal.”

In October of 1960, just a few months after the Greensboro Four
started the sit-ins that swept through the South, Reverend King joined
the Atlanta sit-ins at a restaurant inside Rich’s, a rival department
store to Woolworth’s. He was arrested and, because of his prominence,
was the only one sentenced to hard labor at a maximum-security
prison. Pressure from political figures resulted in his release two
days later. This was only one of the more than 20 times King was
arrested for peacefully protesting.

You can introduce your children to this extraordinary man in [this
short five-minute YouTube video].

* Paint (can make your own—see below)
* Paint brushes
* Cardboard or thick paper (cardstock, etc.)
* Hole punch

   message?
1. Use the paint and paint brushes on the cardboard to make a picket
   sign.
1. Once the paint is dry, glue a craft stick on to the cardboard to
   create a handle to hold.

   cardboard sign.  Repeat with a second cardboard sign. Tie string
   from one cardboard hole to the other piece of cardboard’s hole.
   Repeat on the other side.  Slip this over your child’s head for a
   “sandwich” board version.

## Science: Make Your Own Paint and Color Mixing

|Name| Science: Make Your Own Paint
|Time| 30–60 minutes
|Prep| 10–15 minutes

|Supp| Flour, cold water, salt, food coloring, sauce pan, wooden spoon, several small containers, cardboard or thick paper, fingers or thick paint brushes, Paper towels.

> Hundreds of people walked up and down the sidewalks in front of stores, restaurants, and movie theaters.
> I saw my own sister carrying a picket sign.

You can make homemade finger paint (for picket signs among other things).

**Supplies:**

* 1 cup  flour
* 2.5 cups cold water
* 2 tablespoons salt
* Food coloring
* Sauce pan
* Wooden spoon
* Several small containers (ice cube tray, small class jars, paper cups, or muffin tin)
* Cardboard or thick paper
* Fingers or thick paint brushes
* Paper towels

**Directions:**

1. Mix together the flour and water in a sauce pan over low heat.
Once the mixture is smooth (lumps have been removed) add the salt and
stir again until smooth.
1. Remove from heat.  Pour or spoon the mixture into several small
   containers.  Set aside until cool.
1. Add different food colorings to the different containers and mix it
   in.
1. Use fingers or paint brushes to apply paint to cardboard.
1. Clean up with paper towels.

We took the opportunity to discuss what colors to mix to create other
colors.  After the basic rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
purple), we also worked on some other colors (black, pink) and how to
make the shades darker or lighter.

Our “finger paint” came out pretty thick and a little blobby.  It
worked out okay, but took a while to dry.  My toddler was hands-on
into it.  My 6-year-old preferred using thick paint brushes.  The
mixture took the food coloring quite well and the colors were fairly
vibrant. See [here][paints] for more details.

There are many other DIY paint options, here’s [another] you might
try.
