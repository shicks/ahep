# Escaping Slavery

## Introduction

The long arc of America’s story is all about striving to live up to
the ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence, that “all men
are created equal” and “they are endowed with certain unalienable
rights and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.” The story of Harriet Tubman’s struggle to escape from a
brutal slavery contrasts the passion for freedom that people yearn for
with the abysmal failure to live up to the ideal of American
Exceptionalism that the Declaration promises.

Harriet’s personal relationship with the Lord highlights another
critical aspect of American Exceptionalism: In God We Trust. With the
Lord’s help, Harriet throws off the chains of slavery. And with Him
guiding her, she returns to the Slave States again and again to lead
others to the Free States and their first taste of the promises set
forth in the Declaration.

While Harriet gives all glory to the Lord, her hard (and dangerous)
work also illustrates the American Exceptionalism themes of
self-reliance and, as part of the Underground Railroad, voluntary
associations and community life -- independence and interdependence.

Historically, her story sets the stage for the Civil War. When she
escapes slavery in 1849, the Free States and the Slave States are
exactly even, 15 states apiece. Tensions between the North and South
will rise over the next ten years as Harriet leads more of her people
to freedom and Congressional battles erupt over new states entering
the Union which might tip the balance towards freedom or slavery.

## Geography: Slave States vs. Free States {#geography}

```metadata
toc: "Geography: Slave & Free States"
time: 15 minutes
supplies: U.S. puzzle
```

> I am Your child, Lord; yet Master owns me, drives me like a mule.
> Now he means to sell me south in chains to work cotton, rice,
> indigo, or sugarcane, never to see my family again.

The goal of this exercise is to illustrate the geographic nature of
the slavery issue. It can be done multiple ways. We used a puzzle of
the United States but it can also be used with a paper map of the
United States.

Divide the states into three categories:

1. Free States (15): Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
   Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
   Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin
2. Slave States (15): Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky,
   Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina,
   Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas
3. Non-States, as of 1849, the year Harriet escaped (20): the Western
   states

Outside the puzzle frame, have the children assemble the Free
States. Then, below them, have them assemble the Slave
States. (Alternatively, have them color the Free States one color and
the Slave States a different color). Identify which are the southern
states and which are the northern states by showing them a simple
compass rose with just the four cardinal directions on it.

Ask your children to find the state of Maryland, where Harriet first
lived. Next, ask them to locate the state of Pennsylvania (and the
city of Philadelphia) where Harriet found Free Soil. Then push the
Slave States and the Free States together so they can see how close
Maryland and Pennsylvania are. Finally, point out how far slaves had
to go if they wanted to escape from the Deep South – and why Harriet
had to escape before she was sold “south.”

## Famous American Texts: _In God We Trust_ {#text}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes

> In God We Trust

Time and time again throughout the story Harriet places her trust in
God. Ask your children if they know the official motto (motto: “short
expression of a guiding principle;” “short phrase indicative of
something’s character or use”) of the United States. Show them coins
and currency and ask them to find the motto “In God We Trust''
engraved on each of them. You can also ask them to find the unofficial
mottos of the United States, “Liberty” and “E Pluribus Unum,” (Out of
Many, One) on each of the coins.  The next time you read Moses, ask
them to point out each time Harriet trusted God.

This short phrase can be an easy one for your kids to memorize over
the course of this module.

## Science: Star Gazing {#science}

```metadata
time: 15 minutes
prep: Minimal (download app)
supplies: Star Map App
```

I set the North Star in the heavens and I mean for you to be free.
Harriet sees the star twinkling.  The North Star guided slaves like
Harriet to the Free States. They did not have maps or GPS or road
signs – just the stars in the heavens above. But how did they find the
North Star out of all the stars in the sky?

They used “pointer stars.” The Big Dipper is one of the most
recognizable constellations (technically, an “asterism”) in the night
sky. The last two stars of the Big Dipper “point” to the North Star –
no matter where in the sky the Big Dipper lies.

For this activity you need a clear night. A star map app (e.g., Sky
Guide on iOS) can also be helpful in confirming the North Star (aka,
Polaris) and a lot of fun for pointing out other stars and
constellations.  Many apps (e.g., Google Sky Map) can "time travel"
and move the stars at a faster speed. Show how all the stars spin
around the North Star, but this one star stays still. Verify with a
compass (or compass app) that this star does, in fact, point north.

## Historical Re-enactment: Make Your Own Underground Railroad {#re-enactment}

```metadata

supplies: Paper, Pens, Tape, Scissors, Blankets, Flashlights
```

> Is this heaven, Lord?
> Not heaven, Harriet, FREE SOIL.
{.nowrap}

This immersive activity literally brings home the drama of Harriet
Tubman’s harrowing escape. This activity combines two simple games
that kids love: hide ‘n’ seek and building blanket forts.

### Supplies:
* Blankets
* Paper, Scissors, Pen, Tape
* Flashlights

The first step in building your own Underground Railroad is to
identify and/or build secret hideouts throughout your home. Some of
them can be blanket forts, others can simply be furniture that the
kids can hide behind or under (our most elaborate hideout was a tunnel
made from gymnastic mats to imitate the “potato hole” Harriet hid in
for seven days – we were out of potatoes so we put some oranges in it
and called it the “orange hole”).

The second step is to create a series of North Stars to guide the kids
from hideout to hideout. If your child does not know how to draw a
five-pointed star this can be a fun time to teach them. If they do,
make at least enough of them to match the number of hideouts. Number
the stars and attach them in the order you want the kids to follow the
Underground Railroad. If your kids get carried away making North Stars
(like ours did) you can scatter them on the floor to help indicate the
direction they should go.

Finally, when it gets dark, give each child a flashlight. Then, with
one parent acting as the Conductor, assemble in your first hiding
place and wait for “midnight.” The other parent (the Patroller) can
turn off all the lights in the house, with the last one being the room
with the first hideout, simulating daytime turning to night. When it
is “midnight” the Conductor helps lead the kids to the next hideout,
emphasizing the need for quiet so they don’t get caught by the
Patroller.

As the Conductor and kids “ride” the Underground Railroad, the
Patroller “pursues” them, making appropriate comments and noise –
stomping around their hiding places, howling like a bloodhound,
shining a flashlight like a searchlight, simulating daytime/night time
while they hide in the “potato hole.”  And perhaps being right behind
them when they make the final dash to “Free Soil” (“liberty” cookies
at the final station can remind the kids of the rewards brought by
“life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”)

We field tested this exercise with our three-year-old (“We made it to
Freedom!”) and our five-year-old (“Daddy almost got us but we made it
to Free Soil!”) and they both loved it.

## Scripture: Exodus 3:11-12 {#scripture}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and
> bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” And God said, “I will be with
> you.”

If your children are not familiar with the classic Biblical story of
Moses leading his people out of slavery and to the Promised Land, this
is the perfect opportunity to share it with them. Then you can help
them draw the obvious parallels with Harriet Tubman and how God called
her to lead her people out of slavery.

## Vocabulary {#vocabulary}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> While the plantation sleeps, Harriet prays.

The author uses a handful of words that may not be familiar to the
young reader: plantation, dusk, refuge, haven, upriver, sapling,
woes. If they don’t ask what these words mean, after a couple of
readings ask them to describe what they think they mean. For the words
they are unclear about, re-read the context surrounding the words to
see if that helps: “The woman points Harriet to safe havens -- hiding
places for runaways -- and Harriet steals away into darkness.”

Plantation
: place where a large group of plants or trees are being grown

Dusk
: the darker part of twilight; transition to darkness

Refuge
: safe place; sheltered, protected; haven

Haven
: safe place; refuge

Upriver
: against the flow of the water in a river; toward the source

Sapling
: baby tree

Woes
: troubles, problems

## History: Family Connections {#history}

```metadata
time: 10-15 minutes
```

> Risking her own life, Harriet returns to the dreaded South and
> rescues her family.

History comes alive when presented via a heroic tale with exciting
graphics. Dry recitation of names, dates, places and events can’t
compare to showing the personal relationship with the Lord that led
Harriet Tubman to freedom.

Another way to connect children (and adults) to historical events is
through their family history. Harriet’s escape from slavery happened a
long time ago. But we all have ancestors who lived through that
period.  Do you know who they were? Did they live in the North, South,
or West? Or were they in another country? Do you know if they played
any role in the historical events covered in the story? Were there any
similarities between your ancestors and Harriet Tubman or the people
who helped her as part of the Underground Railroad?

## Art: Find the Hidden Animals {#art-animals}

```metadata
time: 5 minutes

```

> In the underbrush, Harriet sinks into a deep sleep.
> God cradles her.
{.nowrap}

When Harriet sleeps in the woods, she is surrounded by many woodland
creatures. See if your kids can find:
* Three foxes
* Three raccoons (one in a tree)
* Two rabbits
* One possum
* One owl
* Eight fireflies

Ask your kids to draw an animal that might live in the woods -- either
one from the story or a different one.

## Art: Let There Be Light! {#art-light}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> In the Promised Land, Philadelphia, the sun shines gold in the
> trees, and Harriet feels light as a cloud.

An important artistic decision is how the artist wants to illuminate
the subjects he or she is painting.  Where is the source of light? How
bright is it going to be? Where are the subjects placed relative to
the light source?

Much of the story takes place at night, as Harriet travels in the
darkness to both avoid detection and to use the North Star to guide
her. Kadir Nelson, the illustrator, uses the moon’s light reflected on
water as the light source at times and the moon’s light directly at
others. During the day, Nelson uses the sun at different times to
highlight his main subject, Harriet. She is backlit, silhouetted at
sunset, and with the sun shining down on her from above.

Ask your children to identify the source and direction of the light in
each picture. What is their favorite picture? Why? Where is the source
of light for it?

## Language Arts: Similes and Metaphors {#language-arts}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> Fly, Harriet. Your faith has wings.

Carole Boston Weatherford uses two powerful metaphors throughout her
story. She introduces us to the first one in the title when she calls
Harriet Tubman “Moses;” later, Weatherford has God telling Harriet,
“Be the Moses of your people.” The second metaphor Weatherford uses
extensively is the Underground Railroad.

Metaphors (and similes) are literary devices for comparing one thing
to another. These comparisons provide a richer, more colorful way to
describe things: rather than saying "very busy" we can say "as busy as
a bee", or instead of "very quick" we could say "quick as a bunny." To
describe someone sleeping deeply we can say they "slept like a log."
Comparisons using "like" or "as" are called similes.  Encourage your
children to think of some similes of their own. If you've observed
your children making comparisons of their own, be sure to point these
out.

Find the similes in the book (or point them out next time you read
it):

1. "flew like a bird", (which leads to a metaphor on the next line
   "your faith has wings")
2. "rises like a sapling"
3. "light as a cloud"
4. “blanket of night”
 
Sometimes we leave out "like" or "as" and just say something "is" what
it's compared to. At the end of the book, God directly calls Harriet
"Moses" rather than saying she's "like" Moses. This is a metaphor. Ask
your children to think of ways that she was like Moses.

Another metaphor in the book is the Underground Railroad, which is
neither underground nor a railroad.  What does “Underground Railroad”
conjure up in their minds when they hear it? How is it a metaphor for
the escape routes used by escaping slaves? It's like a railroad by
having stations and conductors, and it's like it's underground because
it's dark at night and is hidden from casual observers.

## Language Arts: Italics and Fonts {#language-fonts}

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> Lord, don’t let nobody turn me ‘round. I’d rather die than be a slave.
> Harriet, keep going. You have already glimpsed the future.
{.nowrap}

Authors can use different words to convey emphasis, but they can also
write the same word in different styles. These are called fonts. Look
at a few sample pages of the book and identify the three primary fonts
used by the author.

Almost every page includes a dialogue between Harriet and God. In a
typical dialogue, the spoken words are indicated by setting them off
with apostrophes. Because the dialogue between Harriet and God is
unspoken, the author uses different typefaces to mark the
conversation. Whenever Harriet speaks to God, the author uses italics,
where the typeface is slanted, to indicate Harriet’s words.  Whenever
God speaks to Harriet, the author uses a typeface consisting only of
capital letters.

The next time you read the book, ask your children to count how many
lines of italic text are on each page and how many lines are All
Capitals.

Finally, you can sit down at a computer with your children and open up
a blank document with word processing software. Type your children’s
names in different fonts and sizes. If they are old enough, give them
the opportunity to type some letters or names themselves, changing
fonts whenever they want.  Make sure you demonstrate the most common
ways authors use emphasis in their fonts: italics, bold, and
underline. And have fun with the wackier fonts (recommendation: save
fonts like Wingdings till the end because you may lose control at that
point :-)
