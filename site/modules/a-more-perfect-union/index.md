# We The People

## Introduction

The Constitution of the United States of America defines our system of
government. This remarkable document reflects the political genius of
James Madison, regarded as the Father of the Constitution.  First, it
defines a government of limited powers, powers which are delegated to
it by the people. By limiting the power of the federal government, the
founding fathers hoped to maximize the freedoms of the citizens.

Much of the genius of our Constitution resides in how the powers of
the government are separated into three distinct areas: legislative,
executive, and judicial. To keep each of these power centers from
growing too large, checks and balances are built into the Constitution
so that each power center can exert influence over the other.

In addition to the separation of powers within the federal government
there is also the sharing of power between the state governments and
the national government, which is called federalism. Finally, the
founding fathers established a republic, not a democracy, as one more
constraint upon the unchecked power of a national government.

Getting the states to agree to give up any of their power to a
national government was an herculean task. Over the long, hot summer
of 1787 many compromises were needed, including the Great Compromise
of equal representation in the Senate for large and small states as
well as the Three-Fifths Compromise which counted slaves as â…— of a
person for the purpose of representation in the House.
