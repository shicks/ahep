# All Men Are Created Equal

## Introduction

This is the story of the birth of our nation and the most famous
document in our history, the Declaration of Independence. American
exceptionalism starts with the ideas enshrined in this document: “all
men are created equal,” “they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights,” “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Happiness,” “to secure these rights, governments are instituted among
men,” and that governments derive “ their just Powers from the consent
of the governed.” Or as Alice Dalgliesh calls it, “The Story of
Freedom.”



Dalgliesh also touches on other important themes. The Liberty Bell is
prominently placed in her story and she calls out the Biblical
scripture inscribed on it: “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land,
Unto all the inhabitants thereof.” Her final chapter, “To Carry the
News” opens with this line and she repeats it as her final words.



She also highlights the theme of religious freedom and immigration in
this chapter: “The farmer wasn’t British like many of the people in
the colonies. He spoke German. His people had come to America to be
free to worship God in their own way.”

## American Heritage Songbook: “America the Beautiful”

```metadata
toc: "Songbook: America the Beautiful"
time: 5 minutes
freq: daily
```

Katherine Lee Bates wrote the words to America the Beautiful after traveling across the United States to the top of Pike’s Peak in Colorado: “our sojourn on the peak remains in memory hardly more than one ecstatic gaze. It was then and there, as I was looking out over the sea-like expanse of fertile country spreading away so far under those ample skies, that the opening lines of the hymn floated into my mind.”

> O beautiful for spacious skies,
> For amber waves of grain,
> For purple mountain majesties,
> Above the fruited plain!
>
> America! America!
> God shed his grace on thee
> And crown thy good with brotherhood
> From sea to shining sea!
{.nowrap}

Originally published as a poem on the Fourth of July, 1895, it wasn’t
until 1910 that her words were married with the melody we know today.
While many tunes were attached to it (e.g., Auld Lang Syne), the one
that stuck was a hymn written in 1882 by Samuel A. Ward, the organist
and choir director of Grace Church in Newark. All four stanzas of
Bates’ poem call out to God, making Ward’s hymn a fitting
accompaniment.

Many people have argued that America the Beautiful should be our
national anthem instead of The Star-Spangled Banner. While it’s first
verse captures the grandeur of America’s natural beauty, the second
verse pays tribute to our love of freedom and liberty. The third verse
honors those who fought and died for us.

Rarely do you hear all four verses sung together. [This version][1]
(with lyrics) includes the first, third, and fourth. [This version][2]
is more creative, combining the first half of the third verse with the
second half of the second verse. It’s up to the [Mormon Tabernacle
Choir][3] to bring us the complete version.

To keep it fresh for your child(ren), try playing a different version each day before (or after) the reading.

## Famous American Texts: _Declaration of Independence_

```metadata
toc: _Declaration of Independence_
time: 5-10 minutes
freq: daily
```

Thomas Jefferson wrote perhaps the most inspiring and revolutionary
sentence of America’s founding in the Declaration of Independence:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
> unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the
> Pursuit of Happiness.

The phrase “all men are created equal” would inspire generations of
Americans. Abolitionists, suffragettes, and civil rights leaders would
return to them again and again as they fought for recognition of their
own rights to “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.”

Ask your child(ren) to memorize this sentence or, for younger
children, just the phrase. Have them recite before or after each
reading.

## Political Geography: Thirteen Colonies

```metadata
time: 15 minutes
supplies: U.S. puzzle
```

> On the east coast there were thirteen colonies that belonged to Britain.
> Each one was like a little separate country.
{.nowrap}

This activity illustrates how small the United States was when we
started out. It can be done multiple ways; here are some suggestions:

1. Take a puzzle of the United States and have your child(ren) remove
   all the states except the original 13 colonies.
1. Download an [outline map of the United
   States][map]
   that your child(ren) can color. Ask them to color just the original
   13 colonies.
1. Using the outline map of the United States, outline the original 13
   colonies and have your child(ren) cut them out.

[map]: https://coloringhome.com/coloring-page/1710612?album=coloring-page-united-states-map

Next, have your student(s) locate Philadelphia on the map. Then,
locate New York City. Remind them that one messenger had to carry the
Declaration of Independence from Philadelphia to New York so that
George Washington could read it to his soldiers as they awaited
British troops to attack.

Then, ask your student(s) to note which state is farthest away from
Philadelphia. Read the part of the story that discusses how long it
took to reach the southern states (two months!). Remind them that
there were no phones, cars, trains, or planes back in those days and
the fastest way to travel over land to spread the news was by
horseback. Finally, locate the boundary between North and South
Carolina where young Andrew Jackson read the Declaration of
Independence to his neighbors.

## Reading: Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land!

```metadata
time: 0 minutes
freq: daily
```

> Then the bell-ringer pulled on the ropes and the Liberty Bell rang out:
> Liberty throughout the land,
> Liberty to all the people
{.nowrap}

The Liberty Bell is one of the most famous icons of America and it
features prominently in The 4th of July Story. We actually read the
book with a miniature Liberty Bell each day. The kids took turns being
the bell ringer.  Every time the word “liberty” or “bell” is
mentioned, the bell ringer rang the bell.  This helped keep them more
engaged through the somewhat longer text in this story.

## Arts & Crafts: Make Your Own Liberty Bell

```metadata
toc: "Arts & Crafts: Liberty Bell"
time: 30-40 minutes
prep: 20-30 minutes
supplies: plastic cup, foil, pipe cleaners, small bells, toilet paper roll, construction paper, glue, markers, scissors
```

> The Liberty Bell rang out, and all the bells in the city were set to ringing.
> They rang all day and kept on ringing as the stars came out in the night sky.
{.nowrap}

To make your own Liberty Bells, try following the instructions below
(adapted from a [couple][4] of online [sources][5]).

[4]: https://flutteringthroughthegrades.com/liberty-bell-how-to/
[5]: http://agreaterhand.blogspot.com/2010/12/our-visit-to-liberty-bell.html

### Supplies
* Plastic or styrofoam cup
* Aluminum foil
* Pipe cleaners
* Small bells
* Toilet paper roll (or paper towel roll - construction paper could
  substitute as well)
* Construction paper
* Glue
* scissors/knife
* Markers

### Directions:
1. (Adult) Cut two holes in the bottom of the paper/plastic/styrofoam
   cup (I found the knife worked best for this)
1. String a bell on a pipe cleaner and situate the bell in the middle
   of the pipe cleaner
1. Thread the two ends of the pipe cleaner through the two holes in
   the cup so the bell is inside of the cup
1. Cover the cup with aluminum foil.  Glue ends down.
1. To form the cross-tie at the top of your Liberty Bell: (Adult)
   cut/punch four holes in the toilet paper roll (basically two holes
   that go through both sides of the toilet paper roll)
1. Thread the two ends of the pipe cleaner through the four holes of
   the toilet paper roll and twist ends to hold in place
1. Cut small rectangles out of (brown) construction paper.  Write
   “Liberty Bell” on them and glue to the toilet paper roll
1. Use markers (or scissors) to draw (or cut) the crack in the liberty
   bell (and/or further decorations)

My kids liked the bells and loved decorating the Liberty Bell at the
end.  Threading the pipe cleaner through was a bit challenging and so
adult assistance was critical.  At the end, they rang the bells and
said “Liberty for all people; liberty to all inhabitants,” just like
the story.

For younger kids (and older kids who like coloring), there are
multiple [Liberty Bell coloring sheets online][color].

## Science: Capillaries and Quill Pens

```metadata
time: 20-30 minutes
prep: 10 minutes
supplies: "[feather](https://www.etsy.com/listing/792455469/quill-pen-feathers), X-acto or sharp knife, [ink](https://www.dickblick.com/categories/drawing/calligraphy/inks/)"
```

> All day, and part of each night, Thomas Jefferson sat in his rooms
> in a three-story brick house, writing.

Quill pens were the favorite writing instrument at the time of
America’s founding and were used in writing the Declaration of
Independence. They operate on the principle of capillary action
(liquid flows in narrow spaces without the assistance, or even in
opposition to, gravity). To make your own quill pen you only need two
items: a feather and an x-acto knife (or other sharp knife to shape
the feather). Making your own quill pen should be done by an adult
with the kids watching. [Written instructions can be found
here][science-inst] and/or you can watch a [Youtube video on the
process here][science-vid].

[science-inst]: https://www.carlydrew.com/archive/2020/6/15/essential-guide-to-feather-quil-pens
[science-vid]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EIgYQZZIes

Once you have your quill pen you will need ink which you can obtain
from an art supply store or [online][ink]. Quill pens are more
challenging to operate but they can also be more artistic than the
pens we use for day-to-day writing.

## Historical Re-enactment: Signing the Declaration / Spreading the news

```metadata
toc: "Re-enactment: Signing the Declaration"
time: 20 minutes
prep: 10 minutes
supplies: printed Declaration of Independence, quill (or regular) pen
```

> When the men from all the states had agreed, they signed their names.

This is a great activity to do with other homeschooling families,
family friends, and extended family. Getting more people to
participate in the signing enhances the fun and the memories. But you
can also involve extended family when it comes time to “proclaim
liberty throughout the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof.”

Our historical re-enactment of the Signing of the Declaration of
Independence required three items:

1. A quill pen and ink (ideally home made as described above)
1. A copy of the Declaration of Independence with extra space at the
   bottom for additional signatures
1. A daddy willing to act as a pretend horse (bikes, trikes, and
   scooters also work as pretend horses!)

Download a [copy of the Declaration of Independence][decl] (for the
wikipedia version click the download button on the lower right). If
you print it on a standard 8.5x11 paper there will only be a little
room for you and your child(ren) to sign, so consider printing either
US Legal size (8.5x14) or larger (11x17).

[decl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence#/media/File:United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.jpg

Read the first two sentences aloud to your child(ren). Then place your
copy on the table and have every member of the family sign it with the
quill pen or the fanciest pen you have available (very young children
can just make their “mark”).

For the finale, Daddy galloped the kids to Grandma and Grandpa’s house
so they could “spread the news throughout the land” and mount the
signed Declaration on their refrigerator. (Don’t forget the galloping
sounds!)

## Civic Culture: Religion

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> Perhaps the minister read the words on the Liberty Bell just as they
> were engraved on the bell – for they come from the Bible and sound
> like the deep tones of the bell itself:
> “Proclaim liberty throughout the land, Unto all the inhabitants thereof”

There are two strong religious connections worth noting in this
module. The first is in the text of the Declaration itself, where
Jefferson notes that everyone is “endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights.” These “unalienable rights” are bestowed
upon everyone by God and cannot be taken away by governments. In fact,
as the Declaration notes, it is the primary function of government to
protect these natural rights.



Alice Dalgliesh has the Liberty Bell ring throughout her story. Inscribed on it is the bible verse, “Proclaim LIBERTY throughout the Land and unto all the Inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus 25:10). This scripture refers to the Jubilee, when Israelites were instructed to free their slaves. Consider this scripture as an alternate (or additional) memory exercise for your child(ren).

## History: Liberty Bell

```metadata
time: 5 minutes
```

> All through the country the riders went, taking the news that the Liberty Bell had told –
> Liberty throughout the land,
> Liberty to all the people.
{.nowrap}

The Liberty Bell plays a prominent role in Alice Dalgliesh’s
story. But did you know that it wasn’t called the Liberty Bell at the
time of her story? It wasn’t until the 1830s, almost fifty years after
the Declaration of Independence was signed, that abolitionists
starting referring to it as the Liberty Bell as they waged their
campaign to abolish slavery in the United States. The National Park
Service has [a short history of the Liberty Bell][history], including
this section on how it became known as the Liberty Bell:

[history]: https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/stories-libertybell.htm

_The State House bell became a herald of liberty in the 19th century. “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants thereof,” the bell’s inscription, provided a rallying cry for abolitionists wishing to end slavery. The Anti-Slavery Record, an abolitionist publication, first referred to the bell as the Liberty Bell in 1835, but that name was not widely adopted until years later. Millions of Americans became familiar with the bell in popular culture through George Lippard’s 1847 fictional story “Ring, Grandfather, Ring”, when the bell came to symbolize pride in a new nation. Beginning in the late 1800s, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country for display at expositions and fairs, stopping in towns small and large along the way. For a nation recovering from wounds of the Civil War, the bell served to remind Americans of a time when they fought together for independence. Movements from Women’s Suffrage to Civil Rights embraced the Liberty Bell for both protest and celebration. Now a worldwide symbol, the bell’s message of liberty remains just as relevant and powerful today: “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants thereof.”_

## Art History: John Trumbull’s _Declaration of Independence_

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
supplies: "$2 bill (optional)"
```

> But when the Declaration of Independence was finished, most of the
> words were Thomas Jefferson’s.

John Trumbull painted the most iconic painting of the Declaration of
Independence in 1818 when most of the signers were still alive. The
large (12’ by 18’) painting was hung in the rotunda of the United
States Capitol in 1826. The scene is set in Independence Hall and
depicts the five man committee (Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin
Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston) tasked with drafting the
Declaration as they present it to John Hancock, the president of the
Second Continental Congress.

Ask your kids to examine the painting. Thomas Jefferson is the most
important author of the Declaration of Independence. Without
identifying him, can your child(ren) find him? What makes him stand
out in the painting --- what catches the eye? Trumbull uses a number
of things to draw our attention to Jefferson: he is the only one
wearing a bright color; he is the tallest of the committee of five; he
is in the foreground; he is placed almost in the center of the
painting; all the others are staring towards him; he is the one
holding the Declaration.

Your child(ren) might also be interested in seeing Trumbull’s painting
on the back of the $2 bill, if you can obtain one (there is an image
below but an actual $2 will be more impressive). Jefferson does not
stand out quite so dramatically when everyone is colored green.

## Counting:  Historical Period

```metadata
time: 10 minutes
```

> Our country was not always the big nation it is now.

For the younger crowd, you can look at Marie Nonast’s illustrations
and discuss elements of the time period as well as practice
counting. We enjoyed pointing out/counting how many dogs, horses,
children, women, boats, drums, etc. were on different pages. I pointed
out that the women and girls all wore dresses (which made them easy to
pick out). We also pointed out other indications of the times (in
addition to attire) such as the use of quill pens.

You can also gather some toy horses, cars and planes and ask your
children what kind of transportation early Americans had to rely
on. Then compare yesteryear with today’s transportation. (This may be
another opportunity to take a gallop on the Daddy horse :-).
