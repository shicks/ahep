## Who would benefit from the American History Education Project?

We designed the Great Picture Books curriculum for homeschooling
parents of 3–8-year-olds who want to pass on to their children the
classic American virtues and values. These parents believe so strongly
in these values that they are blazing a new educational trail for
their children outside traditional schools.

AHEP's Great Picture Books curriculum is optimized for busy
homeschooling parents in multiple ways:

1. The books and activities appeal to children of different
   ages and maturities. Parents and grandparents enjoy spending
   time together and sharing the joy of learning.
2. The activities are easily tailored to the interests of
   children and parents: history, civics, free-market economics,
   literature, songs, arts & crafts, cooking, Biblical scripture,
   science, and geography.
3. The activities are flexible enough to meet the challenge of
   the mini-crises that erupt during every family’s day. Each
   module contains hands-on activities that range from 10 minutes
   to an hour.
4. The books are affordable and available from multiple
   sources: libraries and online booksellers of new and used books.
