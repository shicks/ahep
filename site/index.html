  <h2>Who would benefit from the American Heritage Education Project?</h2>
  <p>We designed the Great Picture Books curriculum for homeschooling
    parents of 3–8-year-olds who want to pass on to their children the
    classic American virtues and values. These parents believe so strongly
    in these values that they are blazing a new educational trail for
    their children outside traditional schools.

  <p>AHEP's Great Picture Books curriculum is optimized for busy
    homeschooling parents in multiple ways:

  <ol>
    <li>The books and activities appeal to children of different
      ages and maturities. Parents and grandparents enjoy spending
      time together and sharing the joy of learning.
    <li>The activities are easily tailored to the interests of
      children and parents: history, civics, free-market economics,
      literature, songs, arts & crafts, cooking, Biblical scripture,
      science, and geography.
    <li>The activities are flexible enough to meet the challenge of
      the mini-crises that erupt during every family’s day. Each
      module contains hands-on activities that range from 10 minutes
      to an hour.
    <li>The books are affordable and available from multiple
      sources: libraries and online booksellers of new and used books.

  <h1>What parents are saying <br> about the curriculum</h1>
  <p>Making the quill was very cool, and it worked great! (I was
    skeptical). My girls were enthralled and happily used them for an
    hour or more. They would have happily gone on longer, but I wanted
    to supervise their use of ink that might stain, and I needed to do
    other things. After making the quill and while using it to sign the
    Declaration, my daughter declared, "This is the best day ever!" I
    think it was a hit :-)

  <p>Having the kids work on the pledge of allegiance was great. They
    say it at school, but they hadn't really learned what the words
    meant. Simply helping them understand the first two words, "I
    pledge" was great. They realized when they said the pledge they had
    an active role -- they were promising to be loyal to America, which
    is one nation under God, that stands for liberty and justice for
    all. After practicing for a few weeks our 4 year old could say the
    pledge well and our 6 year old could explain what each line meant
    (what is "the republic for which it stands" -- our form of
    government isn't a monarchy like the old days, an
    autocracy/communist like China, or a pure democracy where 50.1%
    makes the rules).

  <p>That is a seemingly simple thing, saying the pledge, but we spent
    hours on it and the kids learned a lot. When even our little ones (4,
    2) see the flag in the Long May She Wave book they will say - 'that
    is the symbol of America! and it still waves!’

  <p>This was a good introduction to talking more about slavery. We've
    talked on and off about it, but it was good to have a week where it
    was talked about regularly. As usual, the reenactment was the big
    hit this week. My eldest talked about it and helped plan it all
    week. She had so much fun doing it that she collected all our stars
    and a play pop-up tent and brought them to Grandma's the next day
    and cajoled everyone into doing it again with Grandma and Grandpa. I
    think Daddy got rather tired of being a slaveowner.

  <p>We liked this lesson a lot! It was very interactive. Our kids had
    the opportunity to volunteer, practice doing encouragement,
    participate in the surprise attack -- all very hands-on. So not just
    learning, but also implementing. Able to put the story and
    principles to life. Loved that a Bible verse was included. Kids
    loved the various arts and crafts!
