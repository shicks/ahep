# How do we leverage AHEP modules?

We designed the modules to be flexible in order to meet the
different needs of different families. We do not expect families to
do every activity in every module. In practice, parents read the
story to their children each day for five days and do 1–2
activities/day. Parents can pick and choose which activities fit
their time constraints, interests, and goals. There is a suggested
order to the activities but it is just that — a suggestion. The menu
of well-organized alternatives allows parents to customize the
learning for their children.

Some activities lend themselves to multi-generational or multi-family
participation. In particular, the “historical re-enactment” is
enhanced by getting grandparents, other homeschooling families, or
family friends involved. Why not share the AHEP fun with family and
friends?
