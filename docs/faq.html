<h2>What are Great Picture Books?</h2>
<div markdown="1">
Your AHEP team evaluates and reviews picture books based on four criteria:
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Does the book have a strong connection to elements of American Exceptionalism?</strong></p>
<p>We want books that illustrate critical elements of American
Exceptionalism from each of the three primary areas: Political,
Civic Culture, and Free Enterprise. We also want them to capture
key historical moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is it a good story?</strong></p>
<p>If the book doesn’t tell a good story, it doesn’t matter how
strongly it connects to American Exceptionalism. The story should
capture the interest of the child as well as the parent and
grandparent. The story should be interesting enough so that it can
be read multiple times. We also want the stories to be uplifting,
inspiring examples of America’s march toward achieving its
goals. Stories that lend themselves to follow-on activities are
also preferred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are the illustrations good?</strong></p>
<p>These are picture books – the art is an integral part of telling
the story. The illustrations should help propel the story and
engage the readers on every page. For younger readers, the art can
be more important than the words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the book appropriate for the age of the child?</strong></p>
<p>Some themes may not be appropriate for younger children. These
should be identified and parents warned ahead of time so they can
apply their own judgment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Is AHEP just a bunch of picture books?</h2>
<p>No! Your AHEP team has designed and
tested 10–12 fun, hands-on activities to accompany every Great Picture
Book. These activities constitute an AHEP module with the goal of
enhancing the story and lessons.</p>
<h2>What are traditional American values? What is American exceptionalism?</h2>
<p>Your AHEP team believes traditional American values constitute the
cultural core of what makes America exceptional among nations. These
values are the building blocks of the American Dream: self-reliance,
strong work ethic, equality of opportunity, voluntary associations,
rule of law, limited government, liberty, <em>E Pluribus Unum</em>, and <em>In God
We Trust</em>.</p>
<h2>Is AHEP just for homeschooling families?</h2>
<p>No! AHEP modules are flexible enough that they can be used for
afterschooling too. Families using AHEP for afterschooling usually
spread the modules out over a longer period of time (e.g., two weeks
or weekends).</p>
<h2>Does a module have to be completed in five days?</h2>
<p>No! Many families need to skip a day or days. Again, the key is
flexibility for the busy homeschooling (or afterschooling) family.</p>
<h2>Is it best to work through the modules in chronological order?</h2>
<p>No! We developed and tested the modules as we found appropriate
picture books. We also found it useful to emphasize some modules
around holidays (e.g., Memorial Day, Independence Day, Constitution
Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas). However, we added a Timeline review
exercise to help keep the chronological sequence straight for the
kids.</p>
<h2>Are you planning any more modules? How many?</h2>
<p>Yes! There are several important American historical events AHEP does
not cover yet. We are still researching and evaluating great picture
books that treat these subjects in an age-appropriate manner. Please
send your suggestions for both books and topics to ahep1776@gmail.com.</p>
<h2>AHEP modules are a fantastic resource for our family! Why aren’t you charging money for them?</h2>
<p>We started AHEP for our grandchildren and then decided other families
might benefit from them also. Some day we will get around to formally
registering AHEP as a non-profit corporation so we can solicit
donations.</p>
<h2>Where can we get the great picture books AHEP uses?</h2>
<p>We tried to select books that were easily obtainable from libraries,
used book sellers, and online book sellers.</p>
<h2>Do you have any future plans for AHEP?</h2>
<p>Yes!</p>
