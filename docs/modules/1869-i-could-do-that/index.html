<h1>Votes for Women!</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <em>Declaration of Independence</em> is a revolutionary document. Its
most memorable phrases include “all men are created equal” and “they
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights; that
among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.” No less
revolutionary was the phrase that followed: “Governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the governed.” This bottom-up
political philosophy ran counter to the top-down philosophy that has
reigned through most of human history.</p>
<p>From our founding, however, women had been excluded from participating
in our political process – local, state, and federal governments
exercised their “just powers” without their consent. <em>I Could Do That!
Esther Morris Gets Women the Vote</em> tells the story of a courageous
woman who helped secure the first statewide victory for women’s
suffrage. The fifty-year struggle culminated in the passage of the
19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920, guaranteeing women the
right to vote and be full partners in America’s political process.</p>
<p>Also important are the other themes the author, Linda Arms White,
weaves into her story. Esther Morris, with her “I Could Do That!”
attitude, epitomizes the work ethic and self-reliance that are
important elements of American exceptionalism. Esther Morris is also
an undaunted, serial entrepreneur, who repeatedly opened her own
millinery businesses as she migrated west.</p>

<blockquote class="nowrap">
<p>Now you have heard of Women’s Rights,
And how we’ve tried to reach new heights.
If we’re “all created equal”… That’s us too!
Oh, we were sufferin’ until suffrage,
Not a woman here could vote, no matter what age,
Then the 19th Amendment struck down that restrictive rule.
And now we pull down on the lever,
Cast our ballots and we endeavor
To improve our country, state, county,

<blockquote>
<p>When the ladies wanted hats to match the dresses, Esther designed
and made those, too.  Soon, she thought about opening a millinery
shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of different options for making your own hat. I tried
to keep things in a similar style to Esther’s hats. <a href="http://almostunschoolers.blogspot.com/2011/04/paper-plate-millinery-easter-bonnets.html?m=1">Here is a link
for paper plate Easter bonnets</a> and <a href="https://justonemomtrying.blogspot.com/2011/08/diy-tea-party-hats.html?m=1">here is one for tea party

<h3>Supplies (Paper Hat)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cardstock or other stiff paper</li>

<li>Take one sheet of paper and measure your child’s head, stapling the
paper into a cylinder shape at the correct size.</li>
<li>Cut a brim for the hat. We did a shorter top-hat style brim for my

<li>Optionally add a ribbon around the base of the hat for style and more of a bonnet look.</li>
<li>See picture.</li>

<h3>Supplies (Felt Hat)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sheets of felt (depending on age of child something larger than
8.5×11 sheet would be preferable)</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Hot glue gun</li>

<li>Take one sheet of felt and fold the long edge in on either side
until they meet in the middle (forming a triangle shape at the
top). See picture.</li>
<li>Fold the top of the triangle down to the edge of the previous
fold. See picture. Hot glue gun this piece in place.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>When Esther was forty-six, she went with John to the presidential
election polls and watched through the window while he voted. “You
know,” she told him when he came out, “I could do that.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wyoming led the way in giving women the right to vote in 1869; the
Wyoming men who voted for women’s suffrage were more than half a
century ahead of the 19th Amendment. In 1870, Wyoming became the first
state with a female public official, when Esther Morris was appointed
justice of the peace. In 1893, Wyoming celebrated its role as a leader
in women’s suffrage by incorporating the motto “Equal Rights” into
their official state seal and their state flag. In 1924 Wyoming was
the first state to elect a female governor (Nellie Tayloe Ross). In
1960, Wyoming placed a statue of Esther Morris in the National
Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol (each state gets to place
just two statues.)  Wyoming’s nickname is “The Equality State.”</p>
<p>In 1820, Esther was only six years old. How many stars are on the flag
on the second page? [23] Ask your child(ren) to start the puzzle of
the United States by placing those 23 states in their place. By 1869,
when Esther was 55 years old and Wyoming’s legislature gave women the
right to vote, another 14 states had joined the United States. Ask
your child(ren) to show how the United States was spreading across the
West by adding those states to the puzzle. Wyoming became the 44th
state in 1890. Ask them to place the next six states in the puzzle
before finishing by placing Wyoming as the 44th.</p>

<p>The 19th Amendment to the Constitution is short and to the point,
making it ideal for memorization for older children.</p>
<blockquote class="nowrap">
<p>The right of citizens of the United States to vote
shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States or by any state
on account of sex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask your kids: Do you know what state you were born in? Did women have
the right to vote in that state before the 19th Amendment to the
Constitution was ratified in 1920? The answer to this question is a
little nuanced.</p>
<p>Only 15 states, almost all in the West, had granted women full voting
rights: Wyoming (1869), Utah (1870), Washington (1883), Montana
(1887), Colorado (1893), Idaho (1896), California (1911), Arizona
(1912), Kansas (1912), Oregon (1912), Nevada (1914), New York (1917),
Michigan (1918), Oklahoma (1918), and South Dakota (1918). The graphic
below shows how women’s suffrage started in the West before spreading
to the East.</p>
<p>Another twelve states had granted women more limited suffrage; they
were granted the right to vote in presidential elections. Several of
them jumped on the bandwagon in 1919 during the ratification fight:
Illinois (1913), Nebraska (1917), Ohio (1917), Indiana (1917), North
Dakota (1917), Rhode Island (1917), Iowa (1919), Maine (1919),
Minnesota (1919), Missouri (1919), Tennessee (1919), Wisconsin (1919).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Esther smiled. She turned to the candidates.  “Then, would you, if
elected, introduce a bill in the legislature that would allow women
to vote?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many ways to illustrate voting. A very simple one that we
used with our kids mimicked women’s suffrage. We decided to vote on
which restaurant to order our dinner from. We made ballots with the
three pre-selected alternatives (two restaurants and a home-cooked
spaghetti dinner). Before distributing the ballots we asked the older
kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should their 18-month-old sister vote? (They decided “no” because
she couldn’t talk or write yet.)</li>
<li>Would it be fair if we only counted the votes from the boys? (They
decided “no” on that one also.)</li>
<li>Would it be fair if we only counted the votes from the girls? (Our
four-year-old daughter was okay with that but relented after some
lobbying by her brother.)</li>
</ul>
<p>After the votes were tallied, we had two more votes to illustrate the
“tyranny of the majority” and why some decisions were inappropriate
for voting.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first vote was to decide who should pick up dinner. Rather than
a secret ballot, we counted to three and asked everyone to point to
who should pick up dinner. With a little pre-planning, the adults
all pointed to the six-year-old. That elicited an immediate protest:
“I can’t drive yet!” We discussed how voting was not a fair way to
select (or force) someone to do something they weren’t willing or
able to do. However, voting would be an appropriate way to select
one person when multiple people had volunteered for a job.</li>
<li>The second vote was to decide who should pay for dinner. Again, we
counted to three but this time we pointed at the four-year-old. She
subverted the lesson by saying, “Okay, I have money in my piggy
bank.” We thanked her for her generosity and then pointed out that
it wasn’t fair for people to vote to force other people to pay for
things they hadn’t volunteered to pay for.</li>

<p>Esther invited the two men running for the territorial legislature
to her house to speak to the citizens.  Then she sent out
invitations to the most influential people in the territory: “Come

</blockquote>
<p>The formal tea party is featured multiple times in this story. This is
a great opportunity to include extended family members, family
friends, or other homeschooling families. You can invite them for a
casual tea party or a more formal affair by asking them to dress
up. At the very least, the kids can wear the hats they made if they
did the “Make Your Own Hat” activity.</p>
<p>To imitate Esther’s tea parties, try making the tea using tea leaves
and pour using a strainer.</p>

<li>Hats</li>
</ul>
<p>Set the table for tea: tea cups and saucers, (fancy) table cloth, spoons, sugar, cream, snacks. Boil water.
Have the children put tea leaves into a serving pot and then watch as you pour the boiling water over
them. Let steep for a few minutes. Have the children set the strainer over a tea cup and pour the tea
through the strainer (which should collect the tea leaves). Add sugar and cream to taste.</p>
<p>Enjoy tea and snacks in your stylish hats. Have the kids re-pour tea as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Marching With Aunt Susan</em></p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Claire Rudolph Murphy</p>
<p><strong>Illustrator:</strong> Stacey Schuett</p>
<p><strong>Year Published:</strong> 2011</p>
<p><strong>Length:</strong> 36 pages</p>
<p>This true story takes place in 1896, more than a quarter century after women got voting rights in Wyoming Territory. Ten-year-old Bessie Pond and her mother meet Susan B. Anthony (“Aunt Susan”), a leader in the Women’s Suffrage movement for over 40 years at the time of the story. Aunt Susan has come to Berkeley, California to advocate, organize, and march in favor of a California referendum that will grant full voting rights to women. Young Bessie and her mother join the movement, marching with Aunt Susan. By now several western states have granted full voting rights to women: Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington. Sadly, the 1896 referendum in California is defeated (it takes until a 1912 referendum passes for California women to gain their right to vote). But the story ends on a positive note as the campaign changes the dynamics in the Pond family.</p>
<p>Make sure your children notice how the banner that Bessie and her friend Rita are carrying changes from one page to the next.</p>

<p>The final section of Proverbs describes the “wife of noble character.” Much of the description could apply to both men and women. Certainly everyone should aspire to speak (and vote) with wisdom. As homeschooling parents, as mothers and fathers, this scripture is particularly apt as we strive to provide “faithful instruction” to our children.</p>
<p>Ask your children to memorize and recite this scripture. With your older children, ask them what it means to be “clothed with strength and dignity.”</p>

<p>The author uses words about different kinds of stores and places with which the young reader might not
be familiar: millinery, saloon, polling place. In addition, there are words associated with politics that may
be unfamiliar: abolitionist, proclamation, legislature, polling place, and suffrage. It’s always good to see
how much your child(ren) can pick up from the context of the story before asking them if they know
what the words mean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On September 6, 1870, one year after her tea party, Judge Esther Morris put on her best dress and walked with her husband, John, and her sons down the dusty street to the polling place. She would be one of a thousand Wyoming women voting that day, the first ever given that right permanently by any governing body in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trace back your family history and share with your children which of your great-grandmothers was the first to vote. What state did they live in and when did it grant women the right to vote? Were they involved in the Women’s Suffrage movement?</p>
<p>Help your children draw a family tree that connects them to their first female ancestor who voted in a presidential election. If you aren’t sure, assume she voted in the first presidential  election after her state granted women voting rights. Bonus question: who won the presidency the year she voted?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Esther strained the tea into cups, one for her mother, one for herself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An artistic motif is an element or theme that is repeated throughout a
story, art, or music. In <em>I Could Do That!</em> the author, Linda Arms
White, begins the story with Esther learning to make and serve
tea. Much later in the story Esther hosts a dramatic tea party where
she first proposes that women in Wyoming should be able to vote.</p>
<p>The illustrator, Nancy Carpenter, brings her own artistic flair to
this motif. Ask your kids to describe the pattern painted on the
teapot and teacups in the early pages. Notice how it is reinforced in
the first four pages, culminating in the two-page illustration on the
death of Esther’s mother? Then ask them if there is any place else in
the story where the flowered teapot and teacups are used? Show them
how the author and illustrator work together, combining their words
and pictures, to create a powerful motif that comes together at a
crucial point of the story.</p>

<p>As they walked, John, who still didn’t think women should vote, tried to coach her on which candidates and issues to vote for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both <em>I Can Do That!</em> and <em>Marching With Aunt Susan</em> the issue of women’s suffrage divides families. Esther Morris’s husband John did not think women should vote. The father of Bessie Pond’s friend, Rita, also did not support voting rights for women. Family relationships are more important than political issues but people sometimes forget that. Discuss with your children how  to “agree to disagree” and respect each other’s rights to their own opinion. Point out how Esther Morris politely but firmly stood her ground.</p>

<h2 id="math">Math: Count the Hats</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Esther opened another hat shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Esther was a serial entrepreneur. She opened up her first hat shop, to
the shock of her fellow citizens, in Oswego, New York. She opened her
second one after she moved to Illinois, and she opened her final
millinery in South Pass City, Wyoming.</p>
<p>To help re-engage your kids in the story after a reading or two, ask
them to count how many hats are on each page. At the end, ask them
which page had the most hats? Which page had the most interesting
hats? Which hat is their favorite? Why did one woman faint and another
cover the eyes of her daughter when Esther opened her first shop?</p>
