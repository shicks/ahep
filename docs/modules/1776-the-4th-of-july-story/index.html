<h1>All Men Are Created Equal</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the story of the birth of our nation and the most famous document in our history, the Declaration of Independence. American exceptionalism starts with the ideas enshrined in this document: “all men are created equal,” “they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,” “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,” “to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,” and that governments derive “their just Powers from the consent of the governed.” Or, as Alice Dalgliesh calls it, “The Story of Freedom.”</p>
<p>Dalgliesh also touches on other important themes. The Liberty Bell is prominently placed in her story and she calls out the Biblical scripture inscribed on it: “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, Unto all the inhabitants thereof.” Her final chapter, “To Carry the News” opens with this line and she repeats it as her final words. She also highlights the theme of religious freedom and immigration in that last chapter: “The farmer wasn’t British like many of the people in the colonies. He spoke German. His people had come to America to be free to worship God in their own way.”</p>
<p>The text is a bit long for younger readers. The Liberty Bell, one of the most famous icons of America, features prominently in the story. Try giving your kids a bell and asking them to ring it every time the word “liberty” or “bell” is mentioned. This helped keep our younger kids engaged in the story, though we did make them take turns as the “Liberty Bell Ringer.”  Other activities can also be done during the reading such as Counting (animals, etc.), coloring sheets, Geography, and Vocabulary (all described below).</p>

<p>Katherine Lee Bates wrote the words to <em>America the Beautiful</em> after
traveling across the United States to the top of Pike’s Peak in
Colorado: “our sojourn on the peak remains in memory hardly more than
one ecstatic gaze. It was then and there, as I was looking out over
the sea-like expanse of fertile country spreading away so far under
those ample skies, that the opening lines of the hymn floated into my
mind.”</p>
<blockquote class="nowrap">
<p>O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties,
Above the fruited plain!</p>
<p>America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published as a poem on the Fourth of July, 1895, it wasn’t
until 1910 that her words were married with the melody we know today.
While many tunes were attached to it (e.g., Auld Lang Syne), the one
that stuck was a hymn written in 1882 by Samuel A. Ward, the organist
and choir director of Grace Church in Newark. All four stanzas of
Bates’ poem call out to God, making Ward’s hymn a fitting
accompaniment.</p>
<p>Many people have argued that <em>America the Beautiful</em> should be our
national anthem instead of <em>The Star-Spangled Banner</em>. While it’s first
verse captures the grandeur of America’s natural beauty, the second
verse pays tribute to our love of freedom and liberty. The third verse
honors those who fought and died for us.</p>
<p>Rarely do you hear all four verses sung together. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZalFp9WUyM">This version</a>
(with lyrics) includes the first, third, and fourth, as does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKdID40WULo">this modern version by Lee Greenwood</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d84zb95e_IY">Cedarmont Kids</a> cover all four verses as does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY3AH14R3mw">this version</a> with lyrics.</p>
<p>To keep it fresh for your child(ren), try playing a different version each day before (or after) the reading. They should be singing along with you when you get to the Supplemental Reading below, with its stunning illustrations of the words to <em>America the Beautiful</em>.</p>

<h2 id="craft">Arts &amp; Crafts: Make Your Own Liberty Bell</h2>
<pre><code class="language-metadata">toc: &quot;Arts &amp; Crafts: Liberty Bell&quot;
time: 30-40 minutes
prep: 20-30 minutes
supplies: plastic cup, foil, pipe cleaners, small bells, toilet paper roll, construction paper, glue, markers, scissors
</code></pre>
<blockquote class="nowrap">
<p>The Liberty Bell rang out, and all the bells in the city were set to ringing.
They rang all day and kept on ringing as the stars came out in the night sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make your own Liberty Bells, try following the instructions below
(adapted from a <a href="https://flutteringthroughthegrades.com/liberty-bell-how-to/">couple</a> of online <a href="http://agreaterhand.blogspot.com/2010/12/our-visit-to-liberty-bell.html">sources</a>).</p>
<h3>Supplies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plastic or styrofoam cup</li>
<li>Aluminum foil</li>
<li>Pipe cleaners</li>
<li>Small bells</li>
<li>Toilet paper roll (or paper towel roll - construction paper could
substitute as well)</li>
<li>Construction paper</li>
<li>Glue</li>
<li>scissors/knife</li>
<li>Markers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>(Adult) Cut two holes in the bottom of the paper/plastic/styrofoam
cup (I found the knife worked best for this)</li>
<li>String a bell on a pipe cleaner and situate the bell in the middle
of the pipe cleaner</li>
<li>Thread the two ends of the pipe cleaner through the two holes in
the cup so the bell is inside of the cup</li>
<li>Cover the cup with aluminum foil.  Glue ends down.</li>
<li>To form the cross-tie at the top of your Liberty Bell: (Adult)
cut/punch four holes in the toilet paper roll (basically two holes
that go through both sides of the toilet paper roll)</li>
<li>Thread the two ends of the pipe cleaner through the four holes of
the toilet paper roll and twist ends to hold in place</li>
<li>Cut small rectangles out of (brown) construction paper.  Write
“Liberty Bell” on them and glue to the toilet paper roll</li>
<li>Use markers (or scissors) to draw (or cut) the crack in the liberty
bell (and/or further decorations)</li>
</ol>
<p class="center"><img src="craft2.jpg" alt="example of craft">
<img src="craft1.jpg" alt="another example of craft"></p>
<p>My kids liked the bells and loved decorating the Liberty Bell at the
end.  Threading the pipe cleaner through was a bit challenging and so
adult assistance was critical.  At the end, they rang the bells and
said “Liberty for all people; liberty to all inhabitants,” just like
the story.</p>
<p>For younger kids (and older kids who like coloring), there are
multiple <a href="https://www.coloring.ws/t.asp?t=https://www.coloring.ws/usa/25.gif">Liberty Bell coloring sheets online</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="nowrap">
<p>On the east coast there were thirteen colonies that belonged to Britain.
Each one was like a little separate country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This activity illustrates how small the United States was when we
started out. It can be done multiple ways; here are some suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a puzzle of the United States and have your child(ren) remove
all the states except the original 13 colonies.</li>
<li>Download an <a href="https://coloringhome.com/coloring-page/1710612?album=coloring-page-united-states-map">outline map of the United
States</a>
that your child(ren) can color. Ask them to color just the original
13 colonies.</li>
<li>Using the outline map of the United States, outline the original 13
colonies and have your child(ren) cut them out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, have your student(s) locate Philadelphia on the map. Then,
locate New York City. Remind them that one messenger had to carry the
Declaration of Independence <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+New+York/Philadelphia,+PA/@40.338845,-75.8060751,8z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c6b7d8d4b54beb:0x89f514d88c3e58c1!2m2!1d-75.1652215!2d39.9525839!3e1?entry=ttu">from Philadelphia to New York</a> so that
George Washington could read it to his soldiers as they awaited
British troops to attack them.</p>
<p>Then, ask your student(s) to note <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Atlanta,+GA/Philadelphia,+PA/@36.9055889,-82.4167693,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x88f5045d6993098d:0x66fede2f990b630b!2m2!1d-84.3876845!2d33.748752!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c6b7d8d4b54beb:0x89f514d88c3e58c1!2m2!1d-75.1652215!2d39.9525839!3e1?entry=ttu">which state is farthest away from
Philadelphia</a>. Read the part of the story that discusses how long it
took to reach the southern states (two months!). Remind them that
there were no phones, cars, trains, or planes back in those days and
the fastest way to travel over land to spread the news was by
horseback. Finally, locate the boundary between North and South
Carolina where young Andrew Jackson read the Declaration of
Independence to his neighbors.</p>

<h2 id="famous">Famous American Texts: <em>Declaration of Independence</em></h2>
<pre><code class="language-metadata">toc: &quot;Famous Texts: _Declaration of Independence_&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Thomas Jefferson wrote perhaps the most inspiring and revolutionary
sentence of America’s founding in the Declaration of Independence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the
Pursuit of Happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase “all men are created equal” would inspire generations of
Americans. Abolitionists, suffragettes, and civil rights leaders would
return to them again and again as they fought for recognition of their
own rights to “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.”</p>
<p>Ask your child(ren) to memorize this sentence or, for younger
children, just the phrase. Have them recite before or after each
reading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One day a young French general named Lafayette landed in America. He brought the news that ships and soldiers were coming from France to join the Americans in their fight for liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lafayette visited George and Martha Washington in April, 1781.  They served him gingerbread and the recipe was then referred to as Lafayette Gingerbread.  You can <a href="https://www.mountvernon.org/education/online-activities-for-kids-2/how-to-make-lafayette-gingerbread">read the recipe online</a> or just follow the directions below.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<h2 id="science">Science: Capillaries and Quill Pens</h2>
<pre><code class="language-metadata">time: 20-30 minutes
prep: 10 minutes
supplies: &quot;[feather](https://www.etsy.com/listing/792455469/quill-pen-feathers), X-acto or sharp knife, [ink](https://www.dickblick.com/categories/drawing/calligraphy/inks/)&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>All day, and part of each night, Thomas Jefferson sat in his rooms
in a three-story brick house, writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quill pens were the favorite writing instrument at the time of
America’s founding and were used in writing the Declaration of
Independence. They operate on the principle of capillary action
(liquid flows in narrow spaces without the assistance, or even in
opposition to, gravity). To make your own quill pen you only need two
items: a feather and an x-acto knife (or other sharp knife to shape
the feather). Making your own quill pen should be done by an adult
with the kids watching. You can read about making a quill pen <a href="https://www.thepencompany.com/blog/art-crafts/how-to-make-a-quill-pen/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Making-a-quill-pen/">here</a> and/or you can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EIgYQZZIes">Youtube video on the process here</a>. The basic instructions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain an appropriate feather</li>
<li>Clean the feather; clear the end of the shaft</li>
<li>Create the nib (the writing point): with the  x-acto knife, make a 45 degree cut on the end of shaft</li>
<li>Use repeated strokes of the knife to cut a slit in the pointed end of the shaft</li>
<li>Shape the nib into a sharper point</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have your quill pen you will need ink which you can obtain
from an art supply store or <a href="https://www.dickblick.com/categories/drawing/calligraphy/inks/">online</a>. Quill pens are more
challenging to operate but they can also be more artistic (and fun!) than the
pens we use for day-to-day writing.  Warning: they can also be messy!</p>

<h2 id="re-enactment">Historical Re-enactment: Signing the Declaration / Spreading the news</h2>
<pre><code class="language-metadata">toc: &quot;Re-enactment: Signing the Declaration&quot;
time: 20 minutes
prep: 10 minutes
supplies: printed Declaration of Independence, quill (or regular) pen
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>When the men from all the states had agreed, they signed their names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great activity to do with other homeschooling families,
family friends, and extended family. Getting more people to
participate in the signing enhances the fun and the memories. But you
can also involve extended family when it comes time to “proclaim
liberty throughout the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof.”</p>
<p>Our historical re-enactment of the Signing of the Declaration of
Independence required three items:</p>
<ol>
<li>A quill pen and ink (ideally home made as described above)</li>
<li>A copy of the Declaration of Independence with extra space at the
bottom for additional signatures</li>
<li>A daddy willing to act as a pretend horse (bikes, trikes, and
scooters also work as pretend horses!)</li>
</ol>

you print it on a standard 8.5x11 paper there will only be a little
room for you and your child(ren) to sign, so consider printing either
US Legal size (8.5x14) or larger (11x17).</p>
<p>Read the first two sentences aloud to your child(ren). Then place your
copy on the table and have every member of the family sign it with the
quill pen or the fanciest pen you have available (very young children
can just make their “mark”).</p>
<p>For the finale, Daddy galloped the kids to Grandma and Grandpa’s house so they could “spread the news throughout the land” and mount the signed Declaration on their refrigerator. (Don’t forget the galloping sounds!). An alternative finale is to designate a starting point as Philadelphia and an ending point as New York. Ask your kids to mount their “horses” (bikes, trikes, scooters) and “gallop” to New York to deliver the message to General Washington. This works great for multiple children who can form a relay between “Philadelphia” and “New York.” (Again, don’t forget the galloping sounds!).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the minister read the words on the Liberty Bell just as they
were engraved on the bell – for they come from the Bible and sound
like the deep tones of the bell itself:
“Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, Unto all the inhabitants thereof”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two strong religious connections worth noting in this
module. The first is in the text of the Declaration itself, where
Jefferson notes that everyone is “endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights.” These “unalienable rights” are bestowed
upon everyone by God and cannot be taken away by governments. In fact,
as the Declaration notes, it is the primary function of government to
protect these natural rights.</p>
<p>Alice Dalgliesh has the Liberty Bell ring throughout her
story. Inscribed on it is the Bible verse, “Proclaim LIBERTY
throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus
25:10). This scripture refers to the Jubilee, when Israelites were
instructed to free their slaves. Consider this scripture as an
alternate (or additional) memory exercise for your child(ren).</p>

<p>Editing writing is an important skill (both editing one’s own writing, editing others’ writing, and accepting editing of one’s own writing from others) and will be used throughout one’s lifetime. There are two types of editing: proofreading and copy editing. Proofreading focuses on grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization and formatting. When writers say “the essence of writing is rewriting” they are referring to copy editing, which focuses on clarity, tone, wordiness, transitions and misused words.</p>
<p>In this activity, we practice proofreading. Write a short note (with errors) and then present it to your child(ren) for editing. Emphasize that everyone (even the most experienced writer) needs to do editing to correct and improve his or her work.</p>
<p>For young children, the editing can be as simple as looking for capitalization at the beginning of a sentence.  Point out the periods indicating the end of a sentence and have them check to make sure that all of the next words are capitalized. For example: “Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. he worked hard on it. After he wrote it, many others edited it until everyone was satisfied with it. many parts of the document became famous phrases.”</p>
<p>For older children, they can check for spelling, spacing, capitalization, and punctuation errors. For example:  “Thomas Jefferson wrote the declaration of Independence. he was from Virginia and had red HAIR.he worked hard on it. After he wrote it many others edited it until everyone was satisfied with it. many parts of the document became fmous phrases. My favorite line is &quot;all men are created equal.  What is your favorite part The Declaration of Independence is now in the National Archives inWashington, D.C.”</p>

<p>All through the country the riders went, taking the news that the Liberty Bell had told –
Liberty throughout the land,
Liberty to all the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Liberty Bell plays a prominent role in Alice Dalgliesh’s
story. But did you know that it wasn’t called the Liberty Bell at the
time of her story? It wasn’t until the 1830s, almost fifty years after
the Declaration of Independence was signed, that abolitionists
starting referring to it as the Liberty Bell as they waged their
campaign to abolish slavery in the United States. The National Park
Service has <a href="https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/stories-libertybell.htm">a short history of the Liberty Bell</a>, including
this section on how it became known as the Liberty Bell:</p>
<p><em>The State House bell became a herald of liberty in the 19th
century. “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the
Inhabitants thereof,” the bell’s inscription, provided a rallying cry
for abolitionists wishing to end slavery. The Anti-Slavery Record, an
abolitionist publication, first referred to the bell as the Liberty
Bell in 1835, but that name was not widely adopted until years
later.</em></p>
<p><em>Millions of Americans became familiar with the bell in popular
culture through George Lippard’s 1847 fictional story “Ring,
Grandfather, Ring”, when the bell came to symbolize pride in a new
nation. Beginning in the late 1800s, the Liberty Bell traveled across
the country for display at expositions and fairs, stopping in towns
small and large along the way. For a nation recovering from wounds of
the Civil War, the bell served to remind Americans of a time when they
fought together for independence. Movements from Women’s Suffrage to
Civil Rights embraced the Liberty Bell for both protest and
celebration.</em></p>
<p><em>Now a worldwide symbol, the bell’s message of liberty
remains just as relevant and powerful today: “Proclaim Liberty
Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants thereof.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But when the Declaration of Independence was finished, most of the
words were Thomas Jefferson’s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Trumbull painted the most iconic painting of the Declaration of
Independence in 1818 when most of the signers were still alive. The
large (12’ by 18’) painting was hung in the rotunda of the United
States Capitol in 1826. The scene is set in Independence Hall and
depicts the five man committee (Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin
Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston) tasked with drafting the
Declaration as they present it to John Hancock, the president of the
Second Continental Congress.</p>
<p>Ask your kids to examine the painting. Thomas Jefferson is the most
important author of the Declaration of Independence. Without
identifying him, can your child(ren) find him? What makes him stand
out in the painting — what catches the eye? Trumbull uses a number
of things to draw our attention to Jefferson: he is the only one
wearing a bright color; he is the tallest of the committee of five; he
is in the foreground; he is placed almost in the center of the
painting; all the others are staring towards him; he is the one
holding the Declaration.</p>
<p>Your child(ren) might also be interested in seeing Trumbull’s painting
on the back of the $2 bill, if you can obtain one (there is an image
below but an actual $2 will be more impressive). Jefferson does not
stand out quite so dramatically when everyone is colored green.</p>

<p>Our country was not always the big nation it is now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the younger crowd, you can look at Marie Nonast’s illustrations
and discuss elements of the time period as well as practice
counting. We enjoyed pointing out/counting how many dogs, horses,
children, women, boats, drums, etc. were on different pages. I pointed
out that the women and girls all wore dresses (which made them easy to
pick out). We also pointed out other indications of the times (in
addition to attire) such as the use of quill pens.</p>
<p>You can also gather some toy horses, cars and planes and ask your
children what kind of transportation early Americans had to rely
on. Then compare yesteryear with today’s transportation. (This may be
another opportunity to take a gallop on the Daddy horse :-).</p>
