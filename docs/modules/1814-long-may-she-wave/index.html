<h1>The Star-Spangled Banner</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The American flag is the most important symbol of our country. When
children see the flag it should remind them not only of how
exceptional our country is but also of the men and women who fought
for our freedoms. This story is about the most famous flag in our
history and how it inspired our national anthem, whose soaring lyrics
serve to remind us and connect us to our heritage: “the land of the
free and the home of the brave.”</p>
<p>Underlying the patriotic story of our flag is the empowering story of Caroline and her mother, Mary. At a time when it was rare for women to operate a business, these entrepreneurs successfully launched their Flags and Ensigns enterprise, sewing and selling flags to military and civilian customers. Teaching other young women how to support themselves as seamstresses, these women exemplified our free enterprise traditions, our work ethic, our encouragement of one another, equal opportunity for all, and the self-reliance at the foundation of our country.</p>
<p>The War of 1812 is also called the Second War for Independence. Once
again, we are fighting the British, this time because British warships
were capturing American sailors and forcing them to fight in the
Napoleonic Wars against the French. Once again, we are fighting for
“Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.”</p>

<p>O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light

<p>This is a great opportunity to teach your child(ren) our National
Anthem, <em>The Star-Spangled Banner</em>.  You might want to find a YouTube
video of the song so they can sing along with it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPKp29Luryc">here</a> are
a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lCmBvYMRs">couple</a> of different versions - mixing it up each day will

for them on your preferred instrument. By the end of the week, the
older children should be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkeIRoRBqyE">sing the first verse all the way
through</a>.</p>
<p>Lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key wrote the lyrics to <em>The
Star-Spangled Banner</em> after witnessing the defence of Fort
McHenry. His brother-in-law adapted the melody from an old British
drinking song. It wasn’t until 1931 that Congress approved it as our
National Anthem in a somewhat controversial vote. Other strong
contenders for our national anthem included, <em>My Country ‘Tis of Thee</em>
and <em>America the Beautiful</em>.</p>

But this flag was so large that all of the seamstresses in the house were called to help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many women worked together as a team over an extended period of time
to create the enormous flag that flew over Fort McHenry. In this
activity you can replicate that teamwork and time by creating a
collage flag with multiple members of the family over a period of 2-3
days. This activity is adapted from the <a href="https://meaningfulmama.com/american-flag-collage.html">meaningful mama website</a>.</p>
<h3>Supplies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Magazines that can be ripped</li>
<li>Poster board or other thicker, larger paper</li>
<li>Pencil/Pen</li>
<li>Ruler</li>
<li>Glue Stick</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Trace out a rectangle on the poster board/cardstock/newsprint as
large as you’d like your flag to be. Use the ruler (or have your
child use the ruler) to make lines for the stripes and rectangle
for the blue and stars. You can make this a “Fort McHenry” flag by
including 15 stripes and 15 stars or you can make the more standard
13 stripes.</li>
<li>Go through the magazines and rip out pieces that are red, white,
and blue. Also rip out stars (or things that can serve as
stars). Rip the pieces into suitable strips and shapes to fit in
the outline of the flag you have traced out.</li>
<li>Use the glue stick to glue the pieces of paper onto the flag. Work
together as a team - perhaps have different people be responsible
for different stripes. Take a break and come back to it if it is
too much in one day (Caroline worked on her flag over multiple
days).</li>
<li>Finally glue the “stars” on. Alternatively, you could use star
stickers or a star hole punch if you want more uniform stars.</li>
<li>Hang up your flag to show it off!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Our flag was large enough that my kids and I worked as a team to
complete it. We made it over the course of three days (taking breaks
as the kids lost interest). My three-year-old daughter enjoys ripping
paper and glue sticks so this seemed like her kind of activity. She
also seemed to enjoy pretending to be Caroline and “designing” the
flag by shaping the scraps of paper. We snuck in some practice
counting as the kids counted the stripes and then counted the
completed stripes to get a sense of our progress.</p>

Caroline’s grandmother ironed fifteen stars, each more than two feet wide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make a five-pointed star two-feet wide to get an idea of the size of
the flag (if you want to get the angles right, you can use a string to
draw a circle with radius 12-5/8 inches, then use a slightly longer
string to mark off the five points around the circle, each 14-7/8
inches apart). If you are ambitious, work with your child(ren) to make
five of them. Then, set them on the ground to give them some idea of
the size of Fort McHenry’s flag and why the Pickersgill family needed
so many people and so much room to make it.</p>
<p>For even more fun, we measured out the flag in our backyard, and that
is worth doing if you have the space! It is a good chance to practice
using a measuring tape and rope. We put stakes in the corners and
wrapped rope around them to see the full picture. We were all
astonished at how big it was! We put our two-foot star in it too.</p>
<p>You can also try making a six-pointed star and see which “fits”
better.</p>

<p>By the time of the War of 1812 our country had grown and we had added
a handful of new states. The original flag of the United States of
America had 13 stars and 13 stripes representing the thirteen original
states. How many stars are on the Flag during the War of 1812? (15)
What new states were added after the War of Independence? <strong>Vermont</strong>,
<strong>Kentucky</strong>, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana. Why were there only 15 stars
if there were 18 states? (Congress authorizes new flags. They
authorized the 15 star version of the flag in 1794, after Vermont and
Kentucky were admitted to the Union). How many stripes did the flag
have at that time? (15) How many do we have today? (13) What do they
symbolize? (The original 13 colonies). The 1794 version of our flag
was the only one where additional stripes were added to match the
number of states. In 1818, Congress authorized a new version of the
flag with 20 stars and 13 stripes.</p>
<p>Show how our country grew from the founding in 1776 to the time of the
story in 1814. Use a puzzle of the United States and start with having
your child(ren) place the pieces representing the original 13 colonies
(or use a map where they can color in the states with crayons or
markers). Then, fit the pieces of the five new states into the puzzle
(or color them in, using a different color).</p>

<h2 id="text-pledge">Famous American Texts: The Pledge of Allegiance</h2>
<pre><code class="language-metadata">time: 5 minutes
freq: daily
</code></pre>
<p>What better module to introduce your child(ren) to <em>The Pledge of
Allegiance</em>? According to the United States Flag Code, the pledge
should be recited by standing and facing the flag while placing your
right hand over your heart:</p>
<blockquote class="nowrap">
<p>I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America,
and to the Republic for which it stands,
one Nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 by Francis
Bellamy to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’
arrival in America. Bellamy, a Baptist minister, published it in
<em>Youth’s Companion</em>, a popular national magazine. The publisher and
editors of <em>Youth’s Companion</em> believed that part of their mission was
to promote national pride and the egalitarian ideals at the heart of
American exceptionalism. They were also responsible for an earlier
campaign that made flying the American flag part of every public
school.</p>
<p>Bellamy’s original version was tweaked over the years, first by
Bellamy, then the National Flag Conference (in 1923 and 1924) and
finally by Congress. Congress officially adopted the Pledge in 1942;
in 1954, Congress made the fourth and (so far) final change, adding
the words “under God.”</p>
<p>The pledge includes some words that are probably new to
youngsters. See the <a href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> section below for some
definitions. The Pledge of Allegiance is a standard part of our
naturalization ceremony, where people born in other countries declare
their intention to become American citizens. Have your child(ren)
practice reciting the pledge after each reading of <em>Long May She Wave</em>.</p>

<p>Fort McHenry prepared for their perilous fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This activity starts by building your own Fort McHenry. You and your
kids can make the traditional indoor fort, using blankets, chairs,
pillows, and other furniture. Or strive for something more elaborate
with empty boxes. Don’t forget your flag! You can use one you’ve made
in one of the other exercises or something less elaborate like
patriotic pajama bottoms on a pole.</p>
<p>Once your Fort McHenry is built, it’s time for the British
assault. Place 3-6 “ships” in the “harbor” (carpet for indoors, lawn
for outdoors). Arm your Fort McHenry defenders with appropriate
pretend firearms (we used Nerf weapons, but rubber bands are also fun)
and begin the assault (we used bean bags for bombs bursting in air and
popped bubble wrap to simulate explosions; other families used dryer
balls and glow sticks for bombs). For additional fun, try this at
night with the lights out, using flashlights as strobes to illuminate
the action. For best results, include grandparents – the more
attackers/defenders, the more fun will be had by all!</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>The Star-Spangled Banner</em></p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Francis Scott Key</p>
<p><strong>Illustrator:</strong> Peter Spier</p>
<p><strong>Year Published:</strong> 1973, new edition 2014</p>
<p><strong>Length:</strong> 56 pages</p>
<p>This book is gorgeously illustrated by Caldecott Medal artist Peter Spier. Each line of all four verses of Francis Scott Key’s lyrics is intricately drawn on full and double-page spreads. Just over half the pages are devoted to the battle of Fort McHenry before Spier moves forward in time to more modern depictions of our flag and country. You and your children will lose yourselves in all of Spier’s splendid details. This book is not only an excellent supplement to <em>Long May She Wave</em> but also to the American Heritage Songbook activity. Consider singing or humming along as you turn the pages.</p>

<h2 id="scripture">Scripture: 2 Chronicles 20:15</h2>

<blockquote class="nowrap">
<p>This is what the LORD says to you:
&quot;Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army.
For the battle is not yours, but God’s.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The soldiers defending Fort McHenry faced an entire British fleet, “a battery of cannon pointing toward the fort.” This scripture exhorts us not to be afraid or discouraged because the battle is in God’s hands, not ours. This is an opportunity to remind our children that they will face situations where they are afraid or discouraged – and that the Lord will be with them when those times come. Ask your child(ren) if they have ever been in a situation that made them fearful, nervous, or apprehensive? Bravery is continuing to act despite those fears – and the Lord is with us when we do. America is the home of the brave.</p>

<p>The original Fort McHenry flag is on permanent exhibit at the
Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. But it wasn’t
always there - in fact, the Smithsonian didn’t acquire it until 1912,
almost 100 years after the Battle of Baltimore. The history behind the
flag’s ownership and preservation is fascinating. You can explore it

<p>The Pickersgill family supported themselves by using their talents as
seamstresses to create a variety of “flags and ensigns” that they
could sell to both military and civilian customers. Tell your children
stories about entrepreneurs in your family. Did you ever operate a
lemonade stand when you were growing up?  Mow lawns for your
neighbors? What was your very first job? Share these examples with
your child(ren) to connect them to the story, your family history, and
the free enterprise traditions woven into our national DNA.</p>

<h2 id="find-the-flags">Game: Find the American Flags</h2>
<pre><code class="language-metadata">time: 10 minutes
</code></pre>
<p>This is a fun activity for younger children; both our three-year-old
and our five-year-old loved it. We gathered a variety of digital
photos that contained one or more American flags. Then we displayed
the photos on the screen and asked the kids to find and count the
flags. You can make this exercise more interesting and challenging by
selecting photos where all the flags in the photo are not immediately
obvious. Kids enjoyed the hunt! A few samples:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="flags-monument.jpg" alt="Flags surrounding the Washington Monument">
<img src="flags-shuttle.jpg" alt="Flags on the space shuttle Discovery">
<img src="flags-dc.jpg" alt="Flags around a Washington DC building">
<img src="flags-astronaut.jpg" alt="Flag on astronaut's uniform">
<img src="flags-capitol.jpg" alt="Flags in front of the capitol dome">
<img src="flags-statue.jpg" alt="Flag behind the Statue of Liberty"></p>
<ol>
<li>There are seven flags, six obvious ones and one tiny one way down
the mall (look underneath the fifth flag)</li>
<li>There are two flags, one painted on the side of Discovery and the
big one behind her.</li>
<li>This one’s tricky. One big flag to the left, four big ones to the
right, and a little one above the last flag on the right. Total: 6.</li>
<li>Just one, the arm patch on Jack Swigert’s left shoulder.</li>
<li>Another tricky one. There are at least seven big flags and there is
one tiny one flying in front of the Capitol. Total: 8.</li>
<li>Just one flag - the background.</li>
</ol>
